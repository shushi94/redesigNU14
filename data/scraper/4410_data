We will focus in particular on understanding African American culture not as a timeless \"essence\" but as a vibrant sphere of social practice that has worked against its marginalization by structural inequalities in the United States.\n\nAmong the topics we will address are: the relationship between oral/vernacular traditions and circum-Atlantic slavery; the importance of the church and of the (musical) theater to the segregated public sphere; the debate over gender and class politics in blaxploitation films; and the tension between racial authenticity and white appropriation in American music, from the blues to hip hop.

At that stage, we will consider how a handful of artists have sought to problematize the terms by which black culture is marketed as a global commodity.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 23115, "course_id": 1193, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "STOMPING THE BLUES\nBy MURRAY\nEdition 76\nPublisher: PERSEUS D\nISBN: 9780306803628\nNew $16.95  \nUsed if available $12.70  \n\nDANCING IN THE STREET  \nSMITH \nEdition:99\nPublisher:TRILITERAL\nISBN: 9780674005464   \nREQUIRED   \n New \n $19.50  \n Used  if available  \n $14.65  \n  \nRIGHT TO BE HOSTILE  \nMCGRUDER  \nEdition:03\nPublisher:RANDOM\nISBN: 9781400048571  \nREQUIRED       \nNew \n$16.95  \nUsed  if available  \n$12.70     \n   \nBLACK CULTURE+BLK.CONSCIOUS.-30TH ANNIV \nLEVINE \nEdition:07\nPublisher:OXF\nISBN: 9780195305685  \nREQUIRED       \nNew\n$18.95   \nUsed  if available  \n$14.20   \n \nSTAGING RACE  \nSOTIROPOULOS  \nEdition:06\nPublisher:TRILITERAL\nISBN: 9780674027602  \nREQUIRED       \nNew \n$39.95  \nUsed  if available  \n$29.95  \neTextbook \n$19.95"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "Class participation; quizzes; one short essay (4-6 pages); take-home midterm examination; open-book final examination."}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "The Black Diaspora and Transnationality", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "John Richard Iton", "bio": null, "address": "1860 Campus Dr Crowe 5-139", "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "AF_AM_ST", "catalog_num": "245-0", "section": "20", "room": "555 Clark B01", "meeting_days": "MoWe", "start_time": "15:30:00", "end_time": "16:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 40, "overview": "The course will examine the events, movements, theories and texts that have shaped the development and articulation of the black diaspora.

It was a major achievement of the Black Power era, but is rarely included in standard accounts of the Black Freedom Struggle. In 1968 and 1969, Black college students organized protests on campuses from Los Angeles to Boston, Ann Arbor to Houston, Chicago to Atlanta. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. catalyzed student activism and hastened a major shift in black student consciousness. The student struggle coincided with the Black Arts Movement and the Black Panther Party and both were highly influential on student consciousness. In this seminar, we will closely examine the politics and culture of the Black Student Movement and its impact on university life and policies, and the broader society.  We will rely heavily on primary sources, including pamphlets, speeches and memoirs, but we will also assess representations of the era in secondary scholarship.We will engage such questions as: What influenced the students' choice of protest strategy and tactics?  What was their relationship with the broader black community? Did they ever form coalitions with other students of color or white student activists? How did they approach the media? What were the gender politics of the Black Student Movement? What role did arts and culture play in forming new identities? How did COINTELPRO affect the campus movement?

When can we locate and examine `race' and `racism' in the history of Latin America?  How has `race' mattered in the history of the region?  Has `race' always constituted an organizational category throughout Latin America?  And, how have the politics of race and sexuality converged in the making of Latin American Nations?  Exploring these questions and many more, this graduate seminar offers a survey of the principle themes, sources, methods and arguments animating scholarship on race, sexuality, and modernity in Latin America.  For much of the twentieth century, Latin American nations worked to construct the identities of \"racial democracies\"countries where the scourge of racism and prejudice could not take root due to processes of whitening via mestizaje (racial mixing) and Catholic education.  Yet, in recent decades, several of these countries have come to recognize the failure of such \"projects\" even as a growing number of studies have come to highlight the persistent and insidious patterns of racial discrimination and inequality found throughout the region and its history.  This course examines a growing body of work on race, gender and sexuality, nation, transnationalism, and diaspora in an attempt historicize the theme and realities of `race' in Latin America.  Beginning with literature addressing the foundations and formation of racial subjects in the early modern period, we will survey seminal works addressing `race,' gender, sexuality, and `Africanity' throughout the region, paying particular attention to the ways in which African-descended peoples navigated the political, discursive, and socio-cultural contexts of a \"racialized\" Latin America.   Centering upon the arguments, sources, and methods of historical work addressing these themes, we will endeavor to identify and isolate historiographical trends while raising questions regarding the future directions in the study of racial subjects, gender, sexuality and transnational Latin America.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26574, "course_id": 18262, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Bennett, Colonial Blackness: A History of Afro-Mexico (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2009) \nMara Elena Martnez, Genealogical Fictions: Limpieza de Sangre, Religion, and Gender in Colonial Mexico, (Stanford University Press, 2008)\nMargaret R.

The original works of art, the objects of study in the course, are not literature in the strict sense of the term-written verbal art-but rather take form in oral performance or electronic media like film, TV, radio, recorded disks, audio tape, etc. However, in print and in English translation, the course examples from various genres of African oral verbal arts performances (riddles, poetry, proverbs, panegyric, folktales, trickster tales, hero tales, epics) are all experienced as literature for purposes of analysis and interpretation. Four African films will also serve as primary course \"texts\": Wend Kuuni (1982; Gaston Kabor, dir.; Burkina Faso), Keita: Heritage of the Griot (1995; Dani Kouyat, dir.; Burkina Faso); La vie est belle/Life Is Rosy (1987; Ngangura Mweze and Bernard Lamy, dirs.; Democratic Republic of Congo), and Yeelen (Souleymane Ciss, Mali, 1987, 105 min.).

Three longer (roughly 5 to 10 page) interpretive studies are required:  a wiki contribution posted to Blackboard as a collaborative project, and two traditional-style \"research papers\" which are to be submitted electronically.

Today there are six major companies that control much of what people read, hear and see.  Those firms are AOL-Time Warner, General Electric, Walt Disney, News Corporation, Viacom/CBS, and Bertelsman.\n\tAs the firms passed from largely family owned to publicly traded companies, the pressure for profit from Wall Street has led to cutbacks in the size of the firm's news divisions and a change in news story values that have \"softened\" the types of news that people see on television.\n\tThis course will begin with an examination of the monetary forces that are driving the industry away from its primary mission of information.  Critics, of whom the professor is one, contend that the drive for increasing profits is coming at the expense of both the quality and quantity of news that appear on television and radio, newspapers and magazines, and the Internet.  The ever-diminishing number of news providers is also threatening democracy by limiting the number of voices that can be heard in our society.\n\tWe will examine the impact of these mergers on several areas of news coverage and public discussion:\n\t1.Privacy and scandal, particularly the stories about President Bill Clinton. \n2. The transformation of how the press has covered wars from Vietnam to the new Gulf War.  Has the media gone from watchdog to lapdog?\n\t3.  Race.  Former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley has said, \"America is a nation obsessed with the interplay between African Americans and White Americans.\"  We will examine how the press has covered the issue of race in America and how the press deals with the issue in its own newsrooms.\n\t4.  Politics.  Reporting of scandals and personality has replaced critical evaluations of policy.  The \"horse race\" with its poll-driven coverage is now the norm.

We will focus on three specific areas of laboratory analysis: 1) soil chemistry (phosphorous analysis), 2) plant analysis, and 3) microartifact analysis.  Although archaeologists have traditionally studied \"macro\" artifacts these artifacts can easily be moved out of context, and archaeologists wishing to understand the in-situ spatial organization of activities can not always rely on macro artifacts.  As people use a site or a house they remove artifacts of daily use to trash location often leaving the floors where they worked and socialized without any associated macro artifacts.  As people abandoned sites and homes they often took their portable possessions with them.  Post-depositional processes (such as tree roots or erosion) also lead to moving artifacts out of place.  \n\nMicro analysis in archaeology refers to the study of artifacts and ecofacts that are so small that they are more likely to remain in-situ as people use, abandon, and natural forces take their toll on ancient sites.  Because they will remain in-situ micro artifact and ecofact analysis opens up a window for archaeologists to determine not just what people did in the past, but where they did it.  Due to their small size micro artifacts and ecofacts also tend to be the things that archaeologists miss using traditional excavation and analysis techniques.  Soil goes through the excavators screen and is returned to the site.  Carbonized plant remains and micro artifacts are also often too small to be caught in a typical excavators screen.  New excavation and analytical techniques are required to both collect and examine micro artifacts and ecofacts.  These will be explored in this course.\n\nSchedule:\n\nSECTION I - Microanalysis in Archaeology\n\nCase Studies\nCase Study 1: Ejutla, Mexico\nCase Study 2: Tell Kurdu, Turkey\nCase Study 3: Chan, Belize\n\nMicroanalysis\nSoil Chemistry\nPhosphorous Studies\nMulti-elemental Analysis\nPlant Analysis\nMicroartifact Analysis\n\nSECTION II - Practicum", "topic": null, "attributes": "SoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LAB", "class_num": 26950, "course_id": 1116, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "Open to both undergraduate and graduate students.

Language ideologies are the processes and seemingly common sense beliefs through which people make linkages between social forms and language expression, whether verbal or written.  The comparative and ethnographic study of language ideologies focuses on the historical and political economic experiences that shape these mediations.  This seminar considers language and its relationship to identity, aesthetics, morality, and epistemology as embodied in such domains of social life as religion, gender, law, politics, education, and love.  We consider group-internal consistencies and divergences in looking at cultural conceptions of, for instance, \"pure\" and \"good\" language, the power of writing, the human capacity for self-expression, and the moral imperative of perpetuating minority languages.

This was the moment of World Justice and the advocacy of World Peace.  Then, immediately before the catastrophe of World War I, there was confidence nature would provide limitless hydroelectric power and cheap shelter in gravel and cement (producing concrete). Suddenly the architect had possession of these gifts and seemed the master of the game. \n\tAll too soon these visions distorted into modern total war with tanks, poison gas and the beginning of aerial bombing.  Out of this emerged another, more troubling city of the future - the dry, functional one of Weimar Germany, the USSR, and Le Corbusier.  The Block Museum is planning an exhibition of the urban visions this fraught moment bequeathed us.\n\tChicago - just then at the height of its industrial and intellectual expansion -- was a pivot in this development, producing in quick succession the Burnham Plan (1905-1909), the beginnings of Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City (1901ff), Griffin and Mahony's Canberra plan (1911), and, after the War, Eliel Saarinen's Lakefront vision (1923).   The seminar will focus on these, using the documentation immediately available here at the Art Institute, the Chicago Historical Society and the Block Museum, to lay a foundation for the work of shaping the exhibition.\n\tArchitecture, we have come to understand in the last quarter century (helped by Frank Gehry and Rem Koolhaas), is a profoundly subjective enterprise - not at all a matter of \"problems\" and neat, rational \"solutions\".  But how do architects think? - and how is that thinking negotiated and transformed when facing the immense problems city-making requires, economic, political and aesthetic?  Is the problem the city's array of monuments or of its functional texture?  Is the city distinct from the country or is the future a place of city networks interweaving the two?  What is the nature of urbanism's tremendous (and mostly unexplored) subjectivity?\n\nREADING:\nChristian Topalov, l'Aventure des mots de la ville, 2010\nMichael Darin, La comedie urbaine, 2009\nJacques Lucan, Composition, non-composition, 2009\nCarl Smith, The Plan of Chicago, 2006\nWolfgang Sonne, Representing the State:  Capital City Planning, 2003\nMark Crinson, Modern Architcture and the End of Empire, 2003\nRem Koolhaas, Delirioous New York, 1978\nMSS:  Neil Levine, \"Frank Lloyd Wright, urbanist, 1900-1950\"\nDavid Van Zanten, \"Paris Space\"", "topic": null, "attributes": "No P/N option for this section\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26707, "course_id": 1292, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Internship in the Arts", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "David T Van Zanten", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "ART_HIST", "catalog_num": "496-0", "section": "20", "room": "TBA", "meeting_days": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 10, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 20529, "course_id": 1298, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Graduate Tutorial", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "David T Van Zanten", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "ART_HIST", "catalog_num": "498-0", "section": "20", "room": "TBA", "meeting_days": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 35, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": "No P/N option for this section\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22272, "course_id": 1299, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Teaching Assistantship In Art History", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "David T Van Zanten", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "ART_HIST", "catalog_num": "570-0", "section": "20", "room": "TBA", "meeting_days": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 20, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 21554, "course_id": 8744, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Asian American History", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Denise Khor", "bio": "Denise Khor is currently a visiting scholar at the Center for the Study of Race, Politics, and Culture at the University of Chicago.

We will examine the experiences of Asian immigrants and Asian Americans from a historically-grounded, interdisciplinary perspective that locates these experiences within the international context of diaspora and labor migration and the domestic context of race relations, nation-building and U.S. prominence as a world power. Reaching back to the earliest encounters of Asians with the Americas, we will discuss how European imperialism and American expansionism shaped those encounters into a history that is often closer in nature to the forced migration of African slaves than to the migration of European settlers. We will examine the ways in which images such as the Yellow Peril and the Model Minority have concrete impact on the lived experience of Asian immigrants and Asian Americans, and explore their significance in American discourse on race and racial difference. The significance of race and ethnicity, class, and gender in the ongoing creation of the American nation and Asian American communities will be an important leitmotif throughout this course. Topics include work and labor; nationalism, nativism and anti-Asian movements, including the internment of Japanese Americans; gender, family and generational change, post-1965 immigration, global restructuring and Asian American communities; civil rights and the emergence of Asian American identities; and Asian Americans and multiculturalism in the so-called post-civil rights era.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26536, "course_id": 16496, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "1.

This two-part seminar examines the ways in which Asian American identity is both a race and gendered social category and how that impacts the way love is constructed in our society. Part 1 explores how dominant Western notions of gender and love became linked to particular racial categories, with weakness/femininity being linked to Asia.

Since virtually every topic involves both chemical and biological concepts that are unfamiliar to at least some students, a substantial fraction of each lecture is spent discussing the physical principles behind each area (DNA hybridization kinetics, protein structure and manipulation, mechanisms of enzyme action), summarizing basic biochemical pathways (the regulation of gene expression, alternative mRNA splicing, protein biosynthesis, regulation of pathways by phosphorylation) and reviewing chemical synthesis strategies (combinatorial chemistry).

Our first lectures cover Java variable declaration and initialization, and basic input/output.  From there we move on to Java conditional statements (if, if else, if else if, and switch).  Next, we cover the iterations available in Java: while, do while and for.  We conclude the course by covering the basics of arrays, a GUI interface and objects. Typically, course assignments include four open-book quizzes and six programming asssignments.  The programming assignments usually include at least four indiviudual programs.

A course project will be assigned that involves traffic simulation code development and a related case study. \n\n2. Exams: There will be one in-class mid-term exam. The exam will be closed-book but you may bring one 8-1/2 by 11 inch sheet of paper to the exam. No final exam will be given. \n\n3. Grading: The final grade will be assigned on the following basis: \nHomework 45% \nMid term exam 30% \nCourse project 25% \n\n4. Late submissions: Students are expected to submit their homework and project reports in time. Late homework will not be accepted unless it is the result of an officially excused absence. \n\n5. Working Together: Working together on homework is accepted. However, students are expected to write up their own versions of solutions. Students are required to form teams to do the course project. A team may not have more than two members who will submit a joint project report and receive the same grade. Working together on exams, of course, is forbidden. \n\n6. Calculator: Students may use a graphing calculator on exams and homework. Students may not use laptop computers and/or any machine with symbolic manipulation capabilities on exams."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "CLASS/LAB SCHEDULE / The class meets twice a week for a 2-hr lecture."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "Intended for upper level undergraduate and graduate students.

We may not think about it much, but our bodies do talk. The way we hold ourselves, move and gesture sends signals to others about our authority, confidence, honesty and much more. By becoming conscious of the meanings we express through our bodies, and then developing our skills of bodily communication, we can greatly improve our overall effectiveness in relating to others.

At its origins in the 1790s through the middle of the twentieth century, modern Western feminism fought on two fronts, condemning women's legal and political disenfranchisement as well as more subtle practices and norms, like the wearing of corsets, that shored up women's subordinate status at the level of everyday life.  In this class, we will explore feminism in America after the legal and political battle has, to some extent, been won:  we'll examine the so-called second wave of feminism, from roughly 1960 to 1980.  This exciting, volatile, and radical phase of the feminist movement dedicated its critical energies to problems that persisted beyond women's nominal political and legal enfranchisement.  By disrupting everyday institutions like the Miss American pageant, second-wave feminism revealed that mainstream norms, habits, and assumptions might operate just as powerfully as repressive laws.  Because so much second-wave feminism consists of physical activism, cultural interventions, and artistic production, in this class we will encounter a variety of media:  academic writing, to be sure, but also manifestos, journalism, film, visual art, novels, performances, and documentaries.  An ongoing goal of the class will be to explore the critical methodologies enabled by the second wave.  What tools does second-wave feminism use to read culture?  What tools does second-wave feminism use to re-tell history?\n\tThe class will begin by looking at part of Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (French, 1949; English, 1953) to examine how its foundational claim that \"one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman\" invites us to analyze culture rather than nature.  The remainder of the class is broken into units.  Unit One, \"Beauty,\" includes the documentary \"Miss . . . or Myth?\" (1987) on the Miss American pageant and its feminist re-staging, Gloria Steinem on her experience as a Playboy Bunny (1969), and founding discussions of women's looks by Kate Millet, Germaine Greer, Betty Friedan and others.  Unit Two, \"Housework/ Domesticity,\" covers pivotal texts on women's lives at home (\"The Politics of Housework,\" \"The Personal is Political,\" \"Why I Want a Wife,\" and others); we will examine one mainstream reaction to the feminist critique of domestic labor, Ira Levin's horror novel and adapted film The Stepford Wives.  Unit Three, \"Sex,\" will look at second-wave feminist challenges to both the social and anatomical determinants of eroticism and pleasure (The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm, Sex and the Single Girl, Lesbian Nation, Pornography); we will read one early 70s feminist novel (Erica Jong, Fear of Flying) and one early 70s mainstream romance (Janet Woodiwiss, The Flame and the Flower) to examine their contesting representations of women's sexual desire and agency.  In the course of this comparison, we'll take up the issue of rape, or \"rape culture\" (Susan Brownmiller, Against our Will, and others); the material conditions and ideologies at stake in romance reading; and the charge that second-wave feminism reflected the concerns of only white, middle-class women.  Unit Four of the class will look at feminist cultural production.  We'll look at avant-garde art (Carolee Schneeman's film \"Meat Joy,\" other videos, images, and performances) and cultural provocations (like Valerie Solanas, \"The S.C.U.M. Manifesto\") to consider how these texts challenge high art and aesthetic values down to the present day.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory\n\nNo P/N option for this section\n\nSoComm Humanities/Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26530, "course_id": 1590, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Required texts (tentative list):  class reader, available at Quartet Copies; Erica Jong, Fear of Flying; Ira Levin, The Stepford Wives; Linda Nicholson, ed., The Second Wave:  A Reader in Feminist Theory; Janet Woodiwiss, The Flame and the Flower.\t"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "Lecture with some discussion; Friday discussion sections\nEvaluation Method: One essay; one library feminist artifact project; one final exam"}], "coursecomponent_set": [{"component": "DIS", "meeting_days": "Fr", "start_time": "13:00:00", "end_time": "13:50:00", "section": "60", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-359"}]}, {"title": "Introduction to Critical Theory", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Penelope L Deutscher", "bio": null, "address": "Kresge 3-245", "phone": "847/491-5293", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "COMP_LIT", "catalog_num": "207-0", "section": "20", "room": "University Hall 102", "meeting_days": "MoWe", "start_time": "15:00:00", "end_time": "15:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 40, "overview": "Critical theory is encountered frequently in the study of politics and philosophy, literary theory and cultural analysis. Originally the designation of a group of thinkers associated with the Frankfurt School (particularly Horkheimer, Adorno), it has become a more generally conceived approach for subjecting premises, concepts, categories and methods to a critical reflection rather than taking them for granted. Critical theory may also articulate dimensions of a crisis to which a critical impulse responds. This course introduces students to some efforts at criticism and perceptions of crisis which have given rise to critical theory. The course investigates the beginnings of some radical forms of social and moral critique with a focus on Marx's \"critique of political economy\" and Nietzsche's \"genealogy of morals\". During the early years of the twentieth century, influenced by Freud's revolutionary theories of psychic and social formations, critical theory developed such prominence that a school of thinkers named themselves in its honor. Following a discussion of this development, the course concludes with Michel Foucault's critical reaction to \"critical theory,\" in the interests of formulating new variations on the critical attitude.

Assignments will be adjusted in content and complexity according to student background.\n      Phase One: reviews the fundamental mechanics of sound production and bow strokes through sequenced hands-on experiences (bow only).  Phase Two: involves the application and identification of these principles in selected studies and excerpts.  Phase Three: is devoted to the communication and evaluation of bowing as it relates to interpretation as well as the protocol of the rehearsal process.  The final project is a bowing analysis of a symphonic work which is presented to the class for discussion and feedback.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 25768, "course_id": 8677, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "All are available at Norris Bookstore, can be ordered directly from suppliers indicated, or are on reserve in my studio.\n\n* Berman, J., Jackson, B., & Sarch, K.; Dictionary of Bowing and Pizzicato Terms, 4th. ed., (1999), available through ASTA-NSOA publications.

neurophysiological principles underlying human communication.  The course covers basic mechanisms underlying function of the nervous system, starting with single cells and progressing up through simple reflexes to more complex functions such as speech and language.  Sensory systems including the auditory, visual and somatosensory are described in the context of their importance for communication. The organization of the cerebral cortex is described, and the various deficits resulting from damage to the cortex are presented.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Natural Sciences Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 24582, "course_id": 4416, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain.

These standards may be intuitively understood, and cannot in any case be listed exhaustively; the following examples represent some basic types of behavior that are unacceptable: \nCheating: using unauthorized notes, study aids, or information on an examination; altering a graded work after it has been returned, then submitting the work for regarding; allowing another person to do one's work and submitting that work under one's own name; submitting identical or similar papers for credit in more than one course without prior permission from the course instructors.\nPlagiarism: submitting material that in part or whole is not entirely one's own work without attributing those same portions to their correct source.\nFabrication: falsifying or inventing any information, data, or citation; presenting data that were not gathered in accordance with standard guidelines defining the appropriate methods for collecting or generating data and failing to include an accurate account of the method by which the data were gathered or collected.\n\nhttp://www.communication.northwestern.edu/programs/undergraduate/policies_procedures/academic_integrity/\n\nHIPAA STATEMENT\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy rules went into effect as of April 14, 2003.  As you know, these rules provide federal protection for the privacy of health information and give clients of CSD clinics certain rights regarding the release of their health information maintained by the clinics.  This is a reminder that, as a CSD student, you are obligated to understand and abide by the terms of The School of Communication, Communication Sciences and Disorders, Notice of Privacy Practices and HIPAA Policies & Procedures.  It is particularly important that you refrain from disclosing any information regarding any client of the CSD clinic to any third party without the express permission or approval of the appropriate clinic director.

Previously, legal study had focused on individual cases, considered issues of equity, and was thus backward looking-who should win a particular case narrowly considered?  Given that every court case concerns past events that cannot now be changed, issues of efficiency seemed absent.  Cases were categorized into cells-criminal, contracts, antitrust, and so on.  Understanding the law categorized in one cell did little to help understand another cell.  In brief, traditional legal study was filled with data (cases) for which it had no generally agreed explanatory model.  <br><br>In contrast, law & economics begins with the usual economic assumption that rational actors maximize utility subject to constraint-market constraints (as in most economics courses) but also legal constraints regarding permitted and forbidden behavior.  L&E is forward looking-in the case at bar, how (if at all) will ruling for one litigant affect behavior of potential future litigants who are not in the courtroom and cannot even be identified at present, indeed, who may still be unborn?  Many important choices are yet to be made by those parties, so efficiency issues loom large.  The wealth of legal data (cases) can then be used to test the model.  A similar perspective can be applied to statutory law, and even to informal societal norms.

The course explains the hardware/software interface of a modern x86 computer in detail.   A VMM is an operating system that is implemented directly on top of the hardware interface, and itself presents a hardware interface to higher-level software.  Students will also acquire valuable kernel development skills.\n\nThis is a course in operating systems (OS) design and implementation where the example OS is a VMM. OSes operate very differently from application programs, and the development process is also markedly different. In part, this is because OSes interact directly with the hardware interface provided by the processor and system architecture. A VMM is a particularly interesting kind of OS to learn about because it also has to implement what looks like a hardware interface. By studying a VMM, you will be exposed to both sides of the hardware/software interface. This class will do this by considering a real VMM running on top of real hardware. Some specific examples of what you will learn include:\n# The hardware interface of Intel and AMD x86 and x86_64 processors from an OS perpective. These processors underly almost all modern PCs, Macs, laptops, workstations, and servers.\nModes and privilege levels, exceptions and interrupts, address translation, control registers, IPI, etc.\n# The basic PC systems architecture. This architecture underlies almost all modern PCs, Macs, workstations, and servers.\nPIC/APIC, PIT, PCI, NVRAM, BIOS, etc.\n# Modern kernel development.\nVersion control (git and hg), compilers, assemblers, bintools, image compilation and linking, emulator (qemu), serial debugging, PXE, kgdb, etc.\n# Interrupts and I/O models.\n# Virtual memory.\n# Devices and device drivers.\n# The boot process.\n# Synchronization in an OS kernel.\n# Implementation of basic OS abstractions, such as kernel threads.\n# Hardware virtualization interface (focusing on AMD SVM with some discussion of Intel VT's differences).\n# Whole system virtualization versus paravirtualization.\n# Virtualizing machine modes.\n# Virtualizing virtual memory with shadow and nested paging.\n# Virtual devices - programs that emulate hardware devices.\n# Multicore issues. \n\nLABORATORY PROJECTS:\n\n\nA full quarter group project will extend the codebase of an existing VMM or OS, or provide preliminary exploration of a research question.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 24253, "course_id": 15406, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "Please see the course site:\nhttp://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~pdinda/virt"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "desc": "REFERENCE TEXTBOOKS:\n\nJ.

and Expression\"  Skyscrapers, the automobile, the moving picturesuch highly visible and socially significant emblems of technological achievement have in part defined 20th-century western culture.  How have these innovations influenced the arts?  How, in particular, have they influenced literary production? Creative expression, though often considered intimately tied with individual identity and the emotional life of an artist, is also a product of its era.  Rapid modernization during the twentieth century greatly influenced the form and content of art and literature, sometimes shaping the very techniques artists and writers employed in their creative endeavors. By engaging with twentieth-century art and (mostly American) literature across a variety of genres, this course will focus on literary renditions of a constantly \"progressing,\" usually urban, environmentone populated by progressively taller buildings, faster cars, and more brightly packaged images. \n\nQuestions such as how, to what extent, and to what effect different technological innovations have shaped literary and artistic expression will occupy the bulk of our discussions.

Often the subject matter of such writing explores states of mind that are referred to as non-ordinary reality. A wide variety of genres and subgenres fall under this heading: fabulism, myth, fairy tales, fantasy, science fiction, speculative fiction, horror, the grotesque, the supernatural, surrealism, etc.  Obviously, in a mere quarter we could not hope to study each of these categories in the kind of detail that might be found in a literature class.  The aim in 307 is to discern and employ writing techniques that overarch these various genres, to study the subject through doingby writing your own fabulist stories.  We will be read examples of fabulism as writers read: to understand how these fictions are madestudying them from the inside out so, to speak.  Many of these genres overlap.  For instance they are all rooted in the tale, a kind of story that goes back to primitive sources.  They all speculate: they ask the question What If? They all are stories that demand invention, which, along with the word transformation, will be the key terms in the course.  The invention might be a monster, a method of time travel, an alien world, etc. but with rare exception the story will demand an invention and that invention will often also be the central image of the story.  So, in discussing how these stories work we will also be learning some of the most basic, primitive moves in storytelling.  To get you going I will be bringing in exercises that employ fabulist techniques and hopefully will promote stories.  These time tested techniques will be your entrancesyour rabbit holes and magic doorways--into the figurative. You will be asked to keep a dream journal, which will serve as basis for one of the exercises. Besides the exercises, two full-length stories will be required, as well as written critiques of one and other's work.

Students will apply literary techniques to the composition of short multimedia essays and explore the many ways in which writing with images and sound differs from writing for the page. Like its print counterpart, the video essay is an attempt to see what one thinks about something. The video essay may engage with fact, but tends to be less self-assured than documentary. Rather, the video essay, writes Phillip Lopate, wears confusion proudly as it gropes toward truth. Agnes Varda, the poetic French filmmaker who coined the term cincriture, or film writing, best described the promise of the form when noting that, for her, writing meant more than simply wording a script. Choosing images, designing sound -- these, too, were parts of that process. At its best, the video essay leverages the visceral power of sound and image, builds a sympathetic resonance with language, and enlivens the senses. The goal of this course will be to help students understand how the act of writing, while still driven by language, is now shaped by visual and sonic elements. Students will author short video essays of their own, and will, in the process, learn to record and edit video, produce layered soundscapes, remix and mash-up existing films, and generally wreak multimedia havoc. Technical skills, while a plus, are by no means required. Resourcefulness, on the other hand, will be essential.

One key theme in the course explores how a writer's motive for travel often shapes not only how they depict lands and cultures but determines choices of style and structure of the writing itself. The course also pays particular attention to how gender, race, culture, and class provide different perspectives on not only the worlds described by writers but on the very tradition and enterprise of travel itself.

We'll examine the historical and political determinants, the thematic preoccupations, and the formal mutations that define this distinctively modern genre.  At the same time, the seminar will trace the novel's shaping engagement with what was at once the most solid and most impalpable thing in the eighteenth-century episteme, matter.  We'll read some key texts in eighteenth-century microscopy, experimental chemistry, and empirical philosophy (Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle, John Locke) to get some grounding in the treatment of matter inaugurated by the new mechanical philosophy.  In so doing, we'll ponder how well the stark opposition of immateriality and materiality credited to Ren Descartes applies to eighteenth-century mechanical philosophical and empirical notions of perception, understanding, and materiality.\n\nWe'll spend most of the quarter reading novels which themselves \"experiment\" with the paradoxical impalpability of particulate matter, with the centrality of perception to identity, and with the doctrine of secondary qualities, which locates perceptible qualities (like color or taste) inside the mind of the perceiver rather than inside the object.  Throughout the class, we'll examine the role of eighteenth-century materiality in the formal and thematic engagements of the new genre of the novel:  Where is identity, on the inside or outside of bodies?  What is the ontological status of qualities that are contingent on their passage through the mind of an observer?

We will also talk about the most effective ways to work with this kind of source materials, and how to coordinate our research efforts to benefit the class as a whole.\n\t\nEach student will be required to prepare a content overview of the selected publication in the period chosen and then select an issue or set of issues that the student will analyze in depth in a 20-page paper due at the end of the quarter.  The research paper will be prepared on a prescribed schedule that will include, in addition to the content review, a prospectus, an outline, and a draft of the final paper.  While students will do most of their work independently with the close supervision of the instructor, we will use class meetings to talk about common interests, as well as share our findings.  \n\nThe instructor's expertise focuses on the period between the middle of the nineteenth century and early in the twentieth, and this class is particularly recommended for students interested in that period, but he is willing to try to accommodate students whose own interests focus on a different period.  \n\nTopics need not be expressly literary, and graduate students from other disciplines, especially those primarily interested in American history, are cordially invited to enroll.

As with term papers, each source is to be properly cited in the print version of the presentation, which will be turned in. \n\nEach student will serve as a discussion leader on a rotation basis, which involves a two minute overview of materials read and at least five questions to open our discussion. Each student will write a one-page response paper to each day's readings. These responses are handed in at the end of each class. They will be returned promptly and are to be kept by each student in a notebook for use in preparation for the final paper, which will be handed in with it.

Against the view that modern Haitian literature has evaded historical concerns in favor of pressing contemporary social and political problems, we analyze how the revolution itself generated the rhetorical, literary, and ideological foundation for the emergence and continuous renovation of an intellectual and aesthetic tradition in Haiti, as well as the degree to which subsequent revolutions in Haitian writing correspond to new problematizations of memory, collective trauma, and the historical past. Beginning with a reading of foundational Haitian political writings by Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Boisrond Tonnerre, and Baron de Vastey together with theoretical texts by authors such as C.L.R. James, Sibylle Fischer, tienne Balibar, and Jacques Rancire, we interrogate the relation between the political and the literary in light of the revolution's unique universalist philosophy. We go on to analyze the first Haitian novel, a mid-nineteenth-century allegorical account of the revolution, before moving to twentieth century literary and artistic movements which were stimulated by the first U.S. occupation of Haiti and the rise of the Duvalier dictatorship.  These include Indigenism (Roumain), Marxism (Depestre), Magical Realism (Alexis), Spiralism (Franktienne); as well as the new treatments of the role of sexuality and desire in regimes of violence in literature by women (Chauvet, Dominique). Attention will also be paid to the refiguration of historical memory in vaudou cosmology, and, time allowing, the problem of diaspora.

It is a relatively new area of focus, appearing only twenty-five or thirty years ago, as biomedicine developed new social and economic powers, as health resources became expensive and scarce, and as political concerns emerged about identifying a just way of allocating resources in the face of scarcity.  Furthermore, the interconnectedness between clinical medicine, research medicine, public health, and the public and private funding of research, became quite evident.  \n\nWhen these issues are taken to the world stage they become even more complex.  Infectious disease epidemics, such as HIV/AIDS and SARS, challenge all aspects of the delivery of biomedical and public health care.  How should we approach the regulation of public health now that international air travel is so routine?  What do we think about the international traffic in organs from healthy people for transplant purposes?  Should funders in resource rich countries regulate research in resource poor countries?  What are the responsibilities of the wealthiest countries to the health of the poorest countries?  What is equity in health and is it a human right?  Even the definition of death, for the most part, established on a secure consensus in this country, may be controversial when considered in an international context.  We will also discuss reproductive health issues, such as microbicides and genital cutting, in a global context.  The course will conclude by considering the evidence for the emergence of this new discipline - global bioethics.  Is there a need for a new global perspective on bioethics?  If so, who should define the debate, who should regulate the organizations that oversee it, who should enforce those regulations, and who should fund this effort?  How do we achieve a truly global consensus on bioethics.", "topic": null, "attributes": "SoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26845, "course_id": 16487, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Public Health in Africa", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Kearsley A Stewart", "bio": null, "address": "1810 Hinman Ave., Room #A54A, EV Campus", "phone": "847/491-4830", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "GBL_HLTH", "catalog_num": "305-0", "section": "20", "room": "ANTHRO Sem Rm 104 - 1810 Hinmn", "meeting_days": "We", "start_time": "18:00:00", "end_time": "20:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 15, "overview": "Introduction to: current issues in global and public health in Africa with a special focus on HIV/AIDS in South Africa; methodological issues in HIV/AIDS research in Africa; ethical issues in the conduct of global public health research in Africa.

The course is designed to provide opportunities for music aficionados to experience music and music theater events from the inside-out.  The only prerequisite for the course is a love of the performing arts  --  you don't have to read, perform, or understand music notation to succeed in this course.  However, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time attending rehearsals and concerts (minimally six hours a week), outside of the two required class sessions.  During the in-and-outside of classroom sessions, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance.  Through a series of observations, presentations, interviews, and interactive discussions/seminars, you will be better prepared to listen, observe, and critically analyze performing arts events on and off campus -- during this academic quarter, and hopefully for the rest of your life.\n\nAfter Week One's introduction to the course and the music library,  the Week Two class sessions will concentrate on conducting lessons and video observations of concerts and rehearsals.  In these initial sessions, you will learn many of the techniques needed to lead the world's greatest instrumental and choral ensembles (of course, with many additional years of practice).  Course participants, using their required conductor's baton and music CD's will learn a variety of conducting techniques  --   mastering beat patterns, the expressive use of the left hand, and using the conducting gesture to communicate \"interpretation,\" \"phrasing,\" and \"dynamic shading.\"  You may never conduct a major ensemble, but after meeting the requirements of the class you should have the knowledge and understanding to critically analyze conductors during your future career as a member of audiences for classical and popular music concerts\n\n\n\nProjects and Evaluation Method\n\n\nAn individualized assessment contract will be negotiated during the first two weeks of the quarter to address the creative, musical or scholarly interests of students enrolled in the class.  Specific assignments and projects will be determined after a private conference with Professor Dobroski.   In general, evaluation will be based on engagement in the various course components, including 1) completion of weekly readings, listening assignments, and participation in class discussions to be registered in a course log to be submitted Feb.  7 and March 12th  (20% of final grade); 2) attendance and a written analysis/critique-reactions to eight rehearsals and eight concerts (20% of final grade); 3) preparation of  a collaborative oral/written presentation on music from  the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth or the twentieth century (15%); 4) the preparation of program notes for two compositions being performed at a student solo or chamber music recital this academic quarter with the expectation of having to observe two rehearsals and attend the recital of your \"assigned\" student (15%); 5) the observation of a \"master\" professor in an applied lesson, and/or a class environment, (you will be asked to submit a  brief paper reflecting your observations/impressions. (15%); and  6)  prepare a final research paper and  oral presentation on a topic related to a composer or composition being performed by a School of Music ensemble this quarter (15%).   Again, the choice of assignments will be discussed during our individual appointments at the end of Week One or the beginning of Week Two.\n\nThere will be frequent exchanges with the instructor to insure formative and summative evaluative communication through the Winter Quarter.\n\n\n\nCourse Outline (Weeks One, Two and Three)\n\nAfter meeting with members of the class in private conferences Dr. Dobroski will re-issue and distribute a revised course schedule (see Handout Two:  Weekly Schedule and Initial Assignments, distributed during the second class", "topic": "A Journey From First Rehearsal to Final Performanc", "attributes": null, "requirements": "Enrollment Requirements: WCAS Freshman and Sophomores\n\nReserved for Freshmen and Sophomores", "component": "LEC", "class_num": 25644, "course_id": 3484, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "desc": "Additional recommended books, articles, CD's, DVD's  and VCR's will be provided by the instructor or placed on reserve in the library.\nRecommended Websites for Periodic Reference and Review\n\n\tMusical America:  http://www.musicalamerica.com\n\tAndante Magazine:  http://www.andante.com)\n\tWeb Sites referenced on pp. 432-436 in the Kerman/Tomlinson text"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Kerman, Joseph and Tomlinson.

One might for example choose any number of conjoining terms or prepositions to counter-pose the two general fields, philosophy in music, music as philosophy, philosophy against music or vice versa, etc.   We proceed therefore by bracketing this juncture and placing this place under inquiry.  These procedures befall the ambiguous sphere entitled the `aesthetic' by Alexander Baumgarten's Meditationes Philosophicae (1735), and our readings will derive from primary sources following this seminal text, through the writers and composers of 20th century, and include contemporary commentaries that concern themselves with this domain.  Grades for Music and Philosophy are equally proportioned across class participation, three short response papers, and a final paper in which students develop an argued position from musical and textual evidence supporting one of the linking terms discussed in class.

Beginning with a narrative poem of the Middle Ages, we shall encounter the realm of courtly love in Gottfried von Strassburg's Tristan.  By the latter eighteenth century, Germany's greatest writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had penned his path breaking saga of unrequited love, The Sorrows of Young Werther and generated a cult following. The preoccupations of the late nineteenth-century Prussian aristocracy and bourgeoise with rank, propriety, and adultery haunt the pages of Theodore Fontane's best novel Effi Briest (1891). Obsession with youth and beauty are masterfully realized in Thomas Mann's immortal novella, Death in Venice (1912).  In addition to the literary works, we shall screen and discuss excerpts from two operas, Wagner's Tristan und Isolde and Massenet's Werther as well as two films, Fassbinder's \"Effi Briest\" and Visconti's \"Death in Venice\" to assess the manner in which these classic love stories are enshrined in the literary canon and popular culture.", "topic": "All For Love - German Style", "attributes": "Given in English\n\nNo prerequisite in the language\n\nFreshmen/Sophomores Only\n\n", "requirements": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen and Sophomores", "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22719, "course_id": 1961, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Gottfried Von Strassburg, Tristan.

At its origins in the 1790s through the middle of the twentieth century, modern Western feminism fought on two fronts, condemning women's legal and political disenfranchisement as well as more subtle practices and norms, like the wearing of corsets, that shored up women's subordinate status at the level of everyday life.  In this class, we will explore feminism in America after the legal and political battle has, to some extent, been won:  we'll examine the so-called second wave of feminism, from roughly 1960 to 1980.  This exciting, volatile, and radical phase of the feminist movement dedicated its critical energies to problems that persisted beyond women's nominal political and legal enfranchisement.  By disrupting everyday institutions like the Miss American pageant, second-wave feminism revealed that mainstream norms, habits, and assumptions might operate just as powerfully as repressive laws.  Because so much second-wave feminism consists of physical activism, cultural interventions, and artistic production, in this class we will encounter a variety of media:  academic writing, to be sure, but also manifestos, journalism, film, visual art, novels, performances, and documentaries.  An ongoing goal of the class will be to explore the critical methodologies enabled by the second wave.  What tools does second-wave feminism use to read culture?  What tools does second-wave feminism use to re-tell history?\n\tThe class will begin by looking at part of Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (French, 1949; English, 1953) to examine how its foundational claim that \"one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman\" invites us to analyze culture rather than nature.  The remainder of the class is broken into units.  Unit One, \"Beauty,\" includes the documentary \"Miss . . . or Myth?\" (1987) on the Miss American pageant and its feminist re-staging, Gloria Steinem on her experience as a Playboy Bunny (1969), and founding discussions of women's looks by Kate Millet, Germaine Greer, Betty Friedan and others.  Unit Two, \"Housework/ Domesticity,\" covers pivotal texts on women's lives at home (\"The Politics of Housework,\" \"The Personal is Political,\" \"Why I Want a Wife,\" and others); we will examine one mainstream reaction to the feminist critique of domestic labor, Ira Levin's horror novel and adapted film The Stepford Wives.  Unit Three, \"Sex,\" will look at second-wave feminist challenges to both the social and anatomical determinants of eroticism and pleasure (The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm, Sex and the Single Girl, Lesbian Nation, Pornography); we will read one early 70s feminist novel (Erica Jong, Fear of Flying) and one early 70s mainstream romance (Janet Woodiwiss, The Flame and the Flower) to examine their contesting representations of women's sexual desire and agency.  In the course of this comparison, we'll take up the issue of rape, or \"rape culture\" (Susan Brownmiller, Against our Will, and others); the material conditions and ideologies at stake in romance reading; and the charge that second-wave feminism reflected the concerns of only white, middle-class women.  Unit Four of the class will look at feminist cultural production.  We'll look at avant-garde art (Carolee Schneeman's film \"Meat Joy,\" other videos, images, and performances) and cultural provocations (like Valerie Solanas, \"The S.C.U.M. Manifesto\") to consider how these texts challenge high art and aesthetic values down to the present day.", "topic": "Feminism as Cultural Critique", "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22399, "course_id": 3421, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Required texts (tentative list):  class reader, available at Quartet Copies; Erica Jong, Fear of Flying; Ira Levin, The Stepford Wives; Linda Nicholson, ed., The Second Wave:  A Reader in Feminist Theory; Janet Woodiwiss, The Flame and the Flower.\t"}], "coursecomponent_set": [{"component": "DIS", "meeting_days": "Fr", "start_time": "14:00:00", "end_time": "14:50:00", "section": "63", "room": "University Hall 412"}, {"component": "DIS", "meeting_days": "Fr", "start_time": "15:00:00", "end_time": "15:50:00", "section": "62", "room": "University Hall 412"}, {"component": "DIS", "meeting_days": "Fr", "start_time": "14:00:00", "end_time": "14:50:00", "section": "61", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-359"}, {"component": "DIS", "meeting_days": "Fr", "start_time": "13:00:00", "end_time": "13:50:00", "section": "60", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-359"}]}, {"title": "Sociology of Gender and Sexuality", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Nicola K Beisel", "bio": null, "address": "1810 Chicago, Room 223", "phone": null, "office_hours": "TBA"}, "subject": "GNDR_ST", "catalog_num": "331-0", "section": "20", "room": "Fisk Hall 114", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "12:20:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 20, "overview": "This course explores the changing meanings attached to sexuality and marriage in industrializing and post-industrial American society.

We begin by reading theories on popular culture, taste cultures, and the production and reception of culture.  We consider research on how culture producing institutions draw on ideas about women, men, and sexual identity groups in producing and marketing popular culture.  We analyze the sociological significance of the content of popular culture, and consider critical work on how representations of gender, sexuality, and race function as \"controlling images,\" or ideological tools that influence social perceptions of women, men, lesbians and gays, and ethnic and racial groups.  We then look at questions of reception and audience, by analyzing differences in how people access and consume popular culture based on their gender, sexual orientation, and race.  We consider empirical studies of how people interpret and use popular culture, including analysis of censorship and attempts to control content.  We consider how interpreting pop culture or participating in sub- and pop-culture communities reflects agency, or the ability of people to decide what images, representations, and popular narratives mean in terms of their lives.

We will approach the history of Mexican immigration from multiple angles, including the factors driving migration; the family dynamics of immigrants; immigrant education; the economics of immigration; civil rights activism by and on behalf of immigrants; violence against immigrants; the persistent connections that immigrants maintain with Mexico; the return of immigrants to Mexico; and historical and contemporary debates about immigration.

Most legal disputes never go to trial. And the court's judgmentits final determination of the caseis rarely the end of the story. None of these things is new. How has the trial process changed over the past 400 years? Who went to court, who didn't, and why? How, in the American system, have trials made new lawand why has it been so important for Americans to deny the lawmaking function of courts? What can we learn about American historychanges in the law, in the culture, and the worlds that regular people lived infrom the records left behind after a trial? We will examine a variety of different kinds of trials, some famous, most not. And we will examine them from different angles, as our readings will include documents created by a number of different observersincluding journalists, travelers, lawyers, defendants, plaintiffs, aid workers, and, of course, judges.

After tracing ancient Greek approaches to medicine, physics, the natural sciences, and mathematics, we will turn to the central figures of the scientific revolution: Bacon, Descartes, Galileo, and Newton. Questions we will ask include:  How did early modern science differ from previous ways of contemplating, observing, and interrogating nature? How did the new mechanical and natural philosophers distinguish their new sciences from religion, magic, and \"pseudo-sciences\" such as astrology? And what impact did political events and social conventions of the day have on science?

Jews of Western Europe seeking a point of entry into the modern world looked to Jewish life in medieval Islamic lands as an idealized model of how to remain distinctively Jewish and still be in harmony with their highly sophisticated gentile surroundings. In similar fashion the early development of Islam was greatly influenced by exposure to Jewish concepts, practices, and a commonly shared monotheist history that drew heavily on tales from the Hebrew Bible and its post-biblical permutations.

By the mid-sixteenth century the Spanish crown famously reigned over an empire `in which the sun never set', controlling not only the Iberian Peninsula, but also the Netherlands, large parts of Italy, overseas possessions in the Americas and Asia and holding the German Imperial Crown. It was also one of the most vibrant European societies and economies. After 1640 Spain successively lost its European possessions and receded into the periphery of European intellectual and social life while its economy entered a prolonged phase of stagnation, although it continued to control its Latin American colonies.\n\nThe course starts out by examining the genesis of peninsular Spain into a union of reigns and peoples loosely integrated under a common monarchy. It looks at the diverse religious (Muslim, Jewish, Christian) and linguistic origins that shaped Spanish society, as well as the contrast between urban and rural worlds and the urban rebellion of the comuneros of the early 16th century. It examines the origins and consequences of renewed social control in the 16th century in the form of the famous Spanish Inquisition and asks if religious and political attempts at `unifying' Spanish society and economy were successful. \n\nThe program then turns to comparing the peninsular Spanish experience to that of the Dutch, Italian, Portuguese and German subjects of the Spanish crown and investigates the origins of the revolts that eventually led in some cases to their departure from common rule. It also seeks to understand how the `discovery' of the Americas made Europeans on their own society. By examining the diversity and the unifying elements of the Hispanic experience in the light of its other possessions the course offers an overview of one of the most important European players of the early modern period.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27593, "course_id": 12972, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION:   Europe"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Henry Kamen, Spain, 1469-1714 : A Society of Conflict (Longman, 1991. or other editions, ISBN 978-0582784642)<br>\nJames Casey, Early Modern Spain: A Social History  (Routledge Press,1999, ISBN 978-0415206877)."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "Short paper, mid-term, final paper, class participation"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "Lecture"}], "coursecomponent_set": [{"component": "DIS", "meeting_days": "Th", "start_time": "17:00:00", "end_time": "17:50:00", "section": "62", "room": "University Hall 218"}]}, {"title": "History of Modern France: 20th-century France", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Sarah C Maza", "bio": null, "address": "Harris Hall Room 304", "phone": "847/491-3460", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "HISTORY", "catalog_num": "342-3", "section": "01", "room": "University Hall 122", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "09:30:00", "end_time": "10:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 75, "overview": "This course covers the social, political, and cultural history of France from the 1890s to the present.

While a definition of violence may seem obvious, it is fraught with struggles over questions of legitimacy, in part because violence involves at least three, sometimes overlapping, perspectives: perpetrators, victims, and witnesses. The salience of violence, then, does not flow automatically from every act of will or resistance; violence is defined both by experience and by struggles over defining its legitimate and illegitimate dimensions. The causes and consequences of violence must be approached in both instrumental and moral terms. In African history, we need to see how Africans understood those causes and consequences in their own terms even as we seek larger explanations. This approach should inform our efforts to explore and explain new forms of violence and struggles over its legitimacy in Africa today. This course should help you think critically about historical changes and continuities in a difficult category of the human experience.\n\nThe course will be run seminar style.

We will focus in particular on topics that have transformed the field in the last decade.  These topics include Chinese-Inner Asian relations and the \"new Qing history;\" ethnicity; gender and sexuality; and Chinese legal culture.  Other topics to be addressed include imperialism; intellectual transition; commercialization; and the social and religious roots of late imperial peasant uprisings.  The second goal of the course is to enable students to explore in greater detail a topic of particular interest to them and a topic that will help advance their personal research agendas.

The second unit of the course will read cosmopolitanism from the perspective of Middle Eastern literature, including works by Edwar al-Kharrat, Orhan Pamuk, and Mahmud Darwish, and will focus on the continuities and discontinuities between the cosmopolitan ideal and a globalized reality.\n\nThrough our readings, we will ask questions such as: does cosmopolitanism negate other forms of belonging, such as to a nation or a locality? Is being a citizen of the world the privilege of an elite few, or the burden of many? Is it possible to envision multiple cosmopolitanisms, originating from different perspectives? We will also investigate alternative frameworks for understanding world belonging as they emerge from our readings, such as love, political exile, international justice, and transnational Islam. Highlighting links between the flows of people, capital, and literature, these works often open up avenues for political and literary critique.

How are new media effecting our understanding of what counts as worthy of being remembered? What are the aesthetic and political stakes of artistic projects that make direct use of archival documents? We will start by reviewing examples of archival and counter-archival practice in the first half of the twentieth century (Albert Kahn, Marcel Duchamp, Walker Evans) and then analyze films and installations by contemporary artists such as Jean-Luc Godard, Chris Marker, Agns Varda, Susan Hiller, Sophie Calle, and Walid Raad. As we follow the trail set by these works, we will read texts from the fields of film and visual studies, critical theory, and gender studies.", "topic": "Cinema, Photography, & Archive", "attributes": "SoComm Humanities/Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26586, "course_id": 1444, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Paula Amad, <em>Counter-Archive: Film, the Everyday, and Albert Kahn's Archives de la Plante</em>\nPaperback: 408 pages\nPublisher: Columbia University Press (September 13, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0231135017\nISBN-13: 978-0231135016;\n\nMary Ann Doane,<em>The Emergence of Cinematic Time: Modernity, Contingency, the Archive</em>\nPaperback: 304 pages\nPublisher: Harvard University Press (December 27, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0674007840\nISBN-13: 978-0674007840;\n\nLaura Mulvey, <em>Death 24x a Second: Stillness and the Moving Image</em>\nPaperback: 216 pages\nPublisher: Reaktion Books (March 1, 2006)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1861892632\nISBN-13: 978-1861892638"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "Two short papers, oral presentation, and a longer final paper."}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "New Perspectives in the Humanities", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Martha Biondi", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "HUM", "catalog_num": "302-0", "section": "20", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "12:20:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 10, "overview": "The Black Student Movement of the late 1960s transformed American higher education, leading to affirmative action policies in admissions, greater financial aid, new black cultural centers, more black faculty, and African American and Ethnic Studies.  It was a major achievement of the Black Power era, but is rarely included in standard accounts of the Black Freedom Struggle. In 1968 and 1969, Black college students organized protests on campuses from Los Angeles to Boston, Ann Arbor to Houston, Chicago to Atlanta. The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. catalyzed student activism and hastened a major shift in black student consciousness. The student struggle coincided with the Black Arts Movement and the Black Panther Party and both were highly influential on student consciousness. In this seminar, we will closely examine the politics and culture of the Black Student Movement and its impact on university life and policies, and the broader society.  We will rely heavily on primary sources, including pamphlets, speeches and memoirs, but we will also assess representations of the era in secondary scholarship.\nWe will engage such questions as: What influenced the students' choice of protest strategy and tactics?  What was their relationship with the broader black community? Did they ever form coalitions with other students of color or white student activists? How did they approach the media? What were the gender politics of the Black Student Movement? What role did arts and culture play in forming new identities? How did COINTELPRO affect the campus movement? What happened to this generation of students?", "topic": "The Black Revolution on Campus: 1968 & its legacy", "attributes": "SoComm Humanities/Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 23113, "course_id": 1445, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Required readings include primary and secondary sources.

Marketing managers have unprecedented amounts of data available to assist them in making decisions.  Individuals who understand how to use data to make better decisions and support their arguments with evidence have a great advantage.  This class will focus on developing the following skills.1.\tYou should be able to communicate with members of a market research department.  Although most of you will not choose market research for a career, you will undoubtedly be required to work with a market research department at some time during your career.  It is therefore important that you know how to communicate with market researchers.  You will learn a vocabulary that can be used to describe data, e.g., average, median, quartiles, deciles, percentiles, standard deviations, margins of error.  You will also learn how market researchers think about marketing problems.  Learning these skills will enable you to express your research needs in a language that a market researcher will understand, which will allow you to work more productively and efficiently with them.  \n2.\tYou will learn to read, interpret, and use marketing research reports correctly.  For example, you will learn how to interpret a cross tabulation.  You will learn how to create visual displays of marketing data so that you can make more persuasive marketing presentations and reports.  You will also learn some of the background theory that supports these methods so that you will have a deeper understanding of them.  \n3.\tYou will learn how to use statistical software to run elementary market research reports from a database.  Today marketing managers have computers, access to data sources, and statistical software.  They are no longer dependent upon market research departments for reports.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory\n\nNo P/N option for this section\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27684, "course_id": 900, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "There are no specific prerequisites for this course, but previous exposure to statistics in college-level courses will be helpful.

how this world came to be. Put differently, this course teaches thinking in geographically big, historically deep, and systematic-evolutionary categories. The first part of Global History presents a survey of evolutionary patterns in human history. We will look into the succession of adaptive possibilities: from the first bands of hunters to the (not so) simple farming villages and nomadic shepherding tribes and then all the way to the great agrarian empires and high \"civilizations\". Among the key questions: in what ways are modern humans different from our ancestors of 30 thousand years ago? What did it really take to start growing one's bread; why did archaic rulers erect all those pyramids, giant statues, or great walls; what kind of democracy was Ancient Greece; how Islam helped to reconstruct the Eastern Roman Empire; or how China became the first market economy? Why the unlikely rise of Europe? \nEvaluation criteria: Four short and tight take-home essays each worth 20% of the final grade and another 20% for the discussion participation in sections. The papers may NOT exceed 5 normally formatted pages. Furthermore, everyone will have the right to a one-week extension on the paper assignment, no questions asked. But you can enjoy this privilege only once during the quarter.

The crisis of forced migration which reflects persistent and systematic violations of human rights; profound moral and political legitimation deficits; ecological mismanagement and violence; and conflict-laden, parasitic and hegemonic political economy of globalization have systematically dehumanized tens of millions of innocent people, destroyed vital socio-economic and political infrastructures, provoked widespread and intense xenophobia and destabilized communities and institutions.  This course has adopted the definition of `forced migration promoted by the International Association for the Study of Forced Migration which describes the uprooted as refugees in law, internally displaced population, \"environmental refugees\", people displaced by development projects, policies and programs. This definition is expanded to include human smuggling and trafficking. \n\nThe course will raise questions and highlight debates about the causes and consequences of forced migration and responses to forced migration. An important underlying assumption is that a critical and realistic understanding of the phenomenon will help clarify our understanding of this tragic and prolonged human drama. Hopefully, such an understanding will further clarify our individual and collective obligations to the faltering society.  With these objectives in mind, the course will examine the following themes and topics: debates on forced migration studies versus refugee studies; human rights and international, regional and national legal regimes of protection; causes and consequences of forced migrations; immigration and asylum policies, including xenophobia and racism; asylum and refugee determination procedures; rural and urban refugees; gender dimension of forced migration, vulnerabilities and justice; displaced children; human trafficking; war crimes and genocide; crises of landmines; humanitarian interventions; durable solutions to refugee crises; and peace-building and reconstruction of post-conflict societies.", "topic": "Forced Migration Studies", "attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22492, "course_id": 3477, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "There is no recommended textbook for this course.

A crucial instance of this strategy occurs in his re-appropriation of Dante's poem to help interpret his experience in the camp. Indeed, one of the few bright moments of the book takes place when Levi recites passages from <em>The Inferno</em> by heart, sharing his pleasure with a fellow prisoner. \n\nUltimately, through these two strategic and interconnected texts, we will examine the value and function of literature, in particular its ability to amplify our imagination, to console, to strengthen our ethical commitments, and to witness historical catastrophes.\n\n<strong> TAUGHT IN ENGLISH</strong>", "topic": null, "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\nGiven in English\n\nSoComm Humanities/Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27285, "course_id": 19033, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "<ul><li>Dante, <em>Inferno</em>, trans.

His creative uvre expresses the exhilaration, anxiety, compromises, creativity, openness, and craftsmanship characteristic of the transition. Calvino at the start of his career resisted the appeal of literary realism and neo-realism, and sought to inaugurate an idiosyncratic new genre of fantastic fiction in works such as <em>The Baron in the Trees</em> and <em>Cosmicomics</em>. He then became a member of the international literary group known as Oulipo, whose members were interested in affirming the conception of literature as a game. \n\nFrom the 1970's onward, his playful conception of literature pushed him toward new kinds of literary experimentations and philosophical meditations that find beautiful expression in <em>Invisible Cities</em>, <em>Mr. Palomar</em>, and the \"hypernovel\" <em>If on a Winter's Night a Traveler</em>. What are the advantages and the limits of Calvino's amusing and creative corpus? What are the uses of his literature? This course will explore the notions of neo-realism, the fantastic, modernism, and postmodernism through an examination of Calvino's writings in the context of Italian culture. \n\n<strong> TAUGHT IN ENGLISH </strong>", "topic": null, "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\nGiven in English\n\nSoComm Humanities/Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27293, "course_id": 3107, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "<ul><li>Calvino, <em>Cosmicomics</em> (Harvest Books) </li>\n<li>Calvino, <em>Invisible Cities</em> (Harvest Books) </li>\n<li>Calvino, <em>If On a Winter's Night a Traveler</em> (Harvest Books) </li>\n<li>Calvino, <em>Mr. Palomar</em> (Harvest Books) </li></ul>"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "One oral presentation; one short paper (3 - 4 pages); final paper (9 - 10 pages);"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "No prerequisites in Italian; taught entirely in English"}], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Japanese I", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Noriko Mori", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "JAPANESE", "catalog_num": "111-2", "section": "23", "room": "University Hall 412", "meeting_days": "MoTuThFr", "start_time": "12:00:00", "end_time": "12:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 15, "overview": "This is a year-long elementary Japanese course beginning each Fall.

(2)  How do you get sufficient confidence in your valuation to back your analysis with your own money?  When you buy a stock (or sell, short sell a stock) someone else is on the other side -- why do you think they are wrong and you are right?

At the current \ngrowth rate, Latinos would number over 100 million by the year 2050 and \nthe U.S. would then look and sound much more like the majority of the \nAmericas does today. Latinos also represent one of the most \nincarcerated, most under-employed, most poverty stricken, most \nunder-educated, most politically under-represented, most environmentally \nsickened, and most police brutalized ethnic minority groups in the U.S. \nSuch conditions, however, have a tendency to not get critically \nscrutinized in debates about racial politics in the U.S. This is due to \na tendency to only discuss the social salience of race as it pertains to \nrelationships between African Americans and whites. It is also the \nresult of a popular tendency to view Latinos as a recent newcomer to the \nU.S. polity, as an ethnic group comprised of persons who are in the U.S. \nillegally, and our tendency to ignore the fact that Latinos are a \npopulation whose historical roots predate the very idea of the U.S. as a \nnation state in addition to the evolution of ethnic categories such as \nwhite or African American. This course is an attempt to contest that \ninfluence and to shed a light on the long and dynamic history of Latinos \nin the U.S. and beyond. As an introductory course, it will examine and \ndiscuss the foundational themes, moments, conditions, and persons who \nhave been central to the U.S. Latino population and do across various \nmediums and disciplinary influences.

A major theme of the course is the idea that much of what we can and do identify as \"Latino,\" is knowledge that spills over ethnic, national, class, gender, and sexual boundaries.  There are ways, for example, that the very concept of Latino is exclusionary in that, like all forms of knowledge, it is relational by nature and is then grounded in a socio-logic built upon binaries between insiders and outsiders, spokespersons and those silenced.  Yet still, the term, \"Latino\" is rather vital towards marking a certain epistemological and ontological terrain within the unique histories of Spanish colonialism and U.S. history.  In order to deconstruct the term \"Latino\" in this sense (as a method of re-building it to envision its future), this course will focus much attention on gender and sexual divisions within the Latino community, regional articulations of Latino identity, the history of Latino cultural nationalism, divisions between citizen Latinos and immigrant Latinos, border militarization/immigration politics under President Obama's administration, relationships between Latinos and other ethnic minority populations such as African Americans, and also the relationship between Latinos and places outside of the U.S.  In this regard, as the U.S. has experienced a Latino population boom that is lately the result of global south to global north immigration, the influence and history of Latin America and of the Caribbean on Latino subjectivity will be explored, in addition to the lives and experiences of Spain's now rapidly growing Latino population.  As the U.S.-Mexico border has become increasingly militarized and anti-immigrant hysteria has reached an apex in the U.S., many Latin American immigrants have chosen to migrate, instead, to Spain in search of new lives and opportunities.  This represents an intriguing lens for analyzing the effects of Spanish conquest of the Americas, a moment that many have described as the starting point of Latino history, and that deserves a re-scrutiny considering the eastward, rather than westward, trans-Atlantic migrations that are now occurring.  The course will be qualitatively inter-disciplinary as it will peruse materials from the realm of literature, film, grass roots activism, historiography, music, social theory and electoral politics.  Lastly, the course will be divided equally between lecture and group based discussion and all will be accentuated by multimedia.", "topic": null, "attributes": "SoComm Additional Distro Area\n\n",

There is more to globalization than economics (integration of markets and\nfinances) and technology (integration of information flows into seamless wired/wireless worlds).\nHowever, one cannot avoid discussing economics and technology while exploring the cultural/\ncommunicative dimensions of globalization. The course will explore topics such as: diaspora,\nhybrid identities, cosmopolitanism, the emergence of NGOs (non-governmental organization),\nthe nation-state and global governance, transnational justice, global media, the network society,\nglobal terrorism, and the events of September 11, 2001. These topics and events alert us to the\ncritical importance of culture and communication in understanding the globalized world, full of\npromise and conflict, in which we live today.\nToday's managers have to learn to understand and function in a global marketplace. To\nsucceed in such a marketplace, a manager must recognize and work with local cultural forms\nand practices that impinge upon and transform what were once taken to be simply practical,\ninstrumental, and rational propositions of organization, technology and economics. This\ncourse will seek to foster an awareness and understanding of cultural perspectives, values and\ncommunicative styles and show their relevance to conducting business globally.", "topic": null, "attributes": "No P/N option for this section\n\nPermission of department\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 25009, "course_id": 4302, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Communication Strategy and Competition", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Debra J Aron", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": "847/491-5461", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "MSC", "catalog_num": "519-0", "section": "20", "room": "TBA", "meeting_days": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 35, "overview": "This course is designed to provide an understanding of the economic principles that govern strategic decision-making in order to gain and sustain a competitive advantage in business markets, with special emphasis on communications markets and information technology.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27447, "course_id": 4321, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Contemporary Media in Business, Government & Society", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "James S Ettema", "bio": null, "address": "SEARLE 2240 Campus Dr EV", "phone": "847/491-5833", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "MSC", "catalog_num": "525-0", "section": "20", "room": "TBA", "meeting_days": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 40, "overview": "This course concerns the many intersections between media - both old and new - and social institutions.

First, technology will be prioritized when we view films from the transition to sound cinema (1927-30): How did films and filmmakers from a variety of national cinemas experiment with music and sound at this time, and how did recorded sound transform the film medium?  Second, the industrial production of film and its music will be our focus in a unit on the Hollywood studio system: Looking especially at Warner Bros. melodramas of the 1940s, we will reconstruct a historically appropriate context for the creation and reception of the \"classical\" Hollywood film scores composed by Max Steiner, Franz Waxman, and others. A final case study will address authorship and collaboration between film directors (Jean-Luc Godard, Agns Varda) and composers (Michel Legrand, Georges Delerue) in the French \"New Wave\" of the early 1960s, an aesthetic movement that simultaneously critiqued and paid homage to Hollywood.  Specific films in each unit will be chosen to create connections and contrasts among the various case studies, and will include titles such as Applause, Der Blaue Engel [The Blue Angel], Mildred Pierce, Now Voyager, Une femme est une femme, [A Woman Is a Woman], and Clo de 5  7 [Clo from 5 to 7], among others.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27235, "course_id": 19449, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Composer Topics", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "MUSIC", "instructor": {"name": "Jesse Rosenberg", "bio": "Specialist in 19th- and 20th-century Italian opera, with articles published on Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, and Verdi; papers read at national and international conferences on opera and film music history.

For example, the synchronic development of academic high modernism, rock, the early music movement and (post-)tonal orchestral music points to the range of \"contemporary\" musical styles. However, one of the main issues facing twentieth-century composers, especially in the second half of the century, has been the debate over musical representation. Does music contain metaphor? Does music have intrinsic meaning? Or should music be non-representationalin other words, should the notes \"speak\" for themselves?\n\n \n\nIn this class, we will consider the ambivalence toward the expressive and social functions of music in the second half of the twentieth century. Instead of a survey following a textbook, this course will present a series of case studies drawn from a variety of repertoires and issues including: symphonies by Shostakovich and Harris that supposedly express national and personal identities; abstract academic traditions of Babbitt and Boulez; non-representational minimalism in pieces by Glass, Reich, and Riley; the \"re-introduction of the metaphor\" in the works of John Adams; the concept of fusion in the sacred repertoires of Prt and Tavener; the high value placed on experimentation in the twentieth century; and the interaction among \"art\" and \"popular\" repertoires, among others. Much of the repertoire studied will be instrumental music by American and English composers, and a unit of the class will coincide with and support the residence of John Luther Adams at Northwestern.

We will question existing periodization schemes that marginalize this mainstream style by bifurcating the century along the lines of the death of J. S. Bach or using terms such as \"pre-classical\" and \"late baroque.\" Instead, we will relate galant music to Enlightenment ideas, proto-globalization, cultural homogenization, religious reform, and trends in visual art and literature, noting that this style gained currency equally in theaters, churches and private spaces throughout much of the world. We will also learn music by composers considered the best of their generation - Hasse, Jommelli, Pergolesi, Durante, J. C. Bach, etc - that have been cast aside by notions of \"baroque\" and \"classical\" periods and look at geographies such as England, Mexico and Russia that are frequently overlooked in this period. Recurring queries throughout the course will include \"Did the `Neapolitan School' even exist independently of its international reputation?\" \"How did 18th-century geography and modes of transport affect musical production?\" and \"Is there such a thing as the Classical period and Classical music?\" The class will focus on opera seria and instrumental music.

Using the \"workshop\" as a metaphor for Beethoven's musical culture, the seminar will assume a revisionist standpoint toward dominant trends in Beethoven scholarship and reception, which hold that Beethoven \"liberate[d] music from the stays of eighteenth-century convention, singlehandedly bringing music into a new age\" (Burnham 1995: xvi).

More specifically, we will attempt a holistic analysis of representative works from Beethoven's three stylistic periods (Schlosser 1828; Ftis 1837) as unique instances and (re-)readings of eighteenth-century musical practice---understanding \"eighteenth century\" to signify not a historical period so much as a stylistic disposition. Using the \"workshop\" as a metaphor for Beethoven's musical culture, the seminar will assume a revisionist standpoint toward dominant trends in Beethoven scholarship and reception, which hold that Beethoven \"liberate[d] music from the stays of eighteenth-century convention, singlehandedly bringing music into a new age\" (Burnham 1995: xvi). Through readings on cultural memory (Halbwachs 1939) and post-lingual deafness, we will also investigate the as yet unexplored stylistic and structural consequences of Beethoven's deafness on his music---how his infiirmity inevitably \"cloistered\" Beethoven in an eighteenth-century \"sound world.\"", "topic": "Beethoven's Workshop", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27226, "course_id": 3733, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Selected Topics in Music Theory", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "MUSIC", "instructor": {"name": "Richard D Ashley", "bio": "Professor, music theory and cognition program.

His denunciation of the arts, he says, reflected no unlearned prejudice - he knows the charms of poetry as much as any Greek - rather it was demanded of him by reason itself.  At any rate, his worries are nothing new; they are just a continuation of what he calls \"the ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry.\"  This course will borrow its name from this passage of the Republic, for despite the two and a half millennia that have passed since Plato wrote, the quarrel Socrates speaks of has shown no signs of being resolved. Poets still write out of inspiration, providing imitations of human actions, beautiful and ugly, without drawing any final conclusion as to their ultimate worth. And there still exist philosophers and other intellectuals whose love of poetry is tempered by worries about the moral defectiveness of even the finest of these depictions. \"The Ancient Quarrel Between Philosophy and Poetry\" will explore these positions through a careful study of several philosophic and literary works chosen for their pertinence to this theme.

The second position is that great art merely by being great art is necessarily morally edifying - one never needs to choose between following the demands of art and the demands of morality.  The third possibility is that art is of higher value than morality either because it helps breaks the ground in for the growth of a new morality or because it frees us from the constraints of morality altogether.

Originally the designation of a group of thinkers associated with the Frankfurt School (particularly Horkheimer, Adorno), it has become a more generally conceived approach for subjecting premises, concepts, categories and methods to a critical reflection rather than taking them for granted. Critical theory may also articulate dimensions of a crisis to which a critical impulse responds. This course introduces students to some efforts at criticism and perceptions of crisis which have given rise to critical theory. The course investigates the beginnings of some radical forms of social and moral critique with a focus on Marx's \"critique of political economy\" and Nietzsche's \"genealogy of morals\". During the early years of the twentieth century, influenced by Freud's revolutionary theories of psychic and social formations, critical theory developed such prominence that a school of thinkers named themselves in its honor. Following a discussion of this development, the course concludes with Michel Foucault's critical reaction to \"critical theory,\" in the interests of formulating new variations on the critical attitude. Interested students please note: this is a \"reading intensive\" class, and you are very strongly encouraged to make an advance start over the holiday break, particularly with the Nietzsche reading listed below.", "topic": "Marx, Nietzsche, Freud", "attributes": "Ethics & Values Distro Area\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 23140, "course_id": 18794, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "READING List with ISBNs:\n1) The Freud Reader; Sigmund Freud; ed.

However, no previous knowledge of any specific science is required; the cases will only remain at an elementary commonsense level and serve as illustrations of certain philosophical quandaries. For example, one might wonder why exactly an agnostic but scientifically minded person ought to believe in strings, unverifiable by direct experiment as they are, while he or she thinks it's OK not to believe in other non-verifiable entities like God. Similarly, one might wonder what the difference between creationism and standard evolutionary biology is that justifies regarding one as a correct description of nature and the other an optional system of belief. The former is a metaphysical question that responds to our expectation that scientific theories tell us how the world is, even when that means telling us about invisibly small or unreachably remote parts of nature and the universe. The latter is am epistemological question that responds to our expectation that science is an excellent example of objectivity, in the sense that when something is established following the methods good scientists use, then we ought to believe it. The course will try to introduce in both sorts of issues raised by modern natural science, the metaphysical and the epistemological ones; that is, it will concentrate on methodological questions and the question of realism. We will be guided by nested \"what does it take\"-questions. For example: What does it take for a system of sentences to count as a good scientific theory? What does it take for a scientific theory to be testable by observational and experimental data (and, by the way: what does it take for certain series of experiences to count as data or observations?)? What does it take for a given theory to be better supported by the available evidence than its competitors? What does it take for a given theory to explain the known phenomena in an area of knowledge? What does it take for an explanatory scientific theory to be credited with reference to underlying structures of reality? We will begin with a brief overview of the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17 th century, and then turn to the treatment of certain problems in the contemporary literature, like the problem of induction, the problem of the underdetermination of theory choice by the available data, the problem of rationality and conceptual change, the problem of realism.", "topic": null, "attributes": "SoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26987, "course_id": 2607, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "Commitment to steady and focused work.

Incidentally, all of these results are in some way related to the work of Kurt Godel, and bear on the discovery of set theory in the 19th century.  \n\nSet theory was discovered in the late 1800s by Georg Cantor, and it raised two problems.  The first is that an incautious development of set theory leads quite readily to contradiction.  And yet it seems that set theory is necessary to provide a rigorous construction of the real numbers, and so much of modern mathematics.  Set theory was put on a relatively safe axiomatic foundation by Ernst Zermelo, though there was the worry that an undiscovered contradiction loomed.  Hilbert sought to show that mathematics like set theory could be proved consistent by more certain mathematical methods---those of arithmetic.  Godel's  incompleteness theorems raise serious problems for Hilbert's program.  \n \nSecond, set theory is the basis for a rigorous theory of the infinite.  In particular,  set theory, proves that the set of real numbers is larger than the set of integers, even though both are infinitely large.  Cantor conjectured that there is no set of infinite size between the sizes of the reals and the integers.  The Godel's work on the so-called constructible universe of sets, in conjunction with Cohen's ground-breaking new method of \"forcing\", demonstrated that the standard axioms of set theory cannot determine whether or not Cantor was correct.  We will prove these independence results, and discuss the myriad thorny philosophical questions they raise.  \n \nThe course is thus directed towards proving Godel's incompleteness theorems and the Godel-Cohen independence results in set theory.  These relate to other important developments in 20th century logic, which we will investigate along the way:  the completeness theorem for first-order logic (also due to Godel), the Lowenheim-Skolem theorems, Tarski's theorem on the indefinability of truth, and Church's theorem on the undecidability of First-order logic.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27021, "course_id": 2627, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "Department permission: email j-kasen@northwestern.edu"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "READING List with ISBNs:\nPaul Cohen, Set Theory and the Continuum Hypothesis; ISBN 978-0-486-46921-8"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "EVALUATION METHOD:  Problem sets, at least one presentation per student."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "TEACHING METHOD:  Lectures"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "desc": "Learning Objectives:\nStudents will be expected to understand the proofs of the class's main results, and their significance."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "REQUIREMENTS:\nStudents should have some background in mathematical logic.

No more than one reaction paper per week. As for length, aim for two full pages in length (double-spaced).  Reaction papers will constitute 20% of the final grade. No late reaction papers will be accepted.

Immanuel Kant systematizes and defends several familiar moral ideas, such as the unconditional authority of moral requirements and the dignity of each individual. He argues that acting morally is both a requirement of reason and the condition for our freedom, so that morally wrong action is both irrational and a kind of bondage.  His approach to moral theory persists in its power, and remains one of a handful of live options among moral philosophers working today.  We will engage in a careful study of this system, focusing on the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, and also reading parts of the Critique of Practical Reason, the Metaphysics of Morals, and Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Ethics & Values Distro Area\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": "Enrollment Requirements: Prerequisite: Student must have completed a Philosophy course to register for this class.", "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27025, "course_id": 2635, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "READING List with ISBNs: \nPractical Philosophy;  Immanuel Kant (Mary Gregor, ed); Cambridge, 1999; 0-521-65408-4\n\nReligion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason ; Immanuel Kant, (Allen Wood and George di Giovanni, trans.); Cambridge, 1999; 0-521-59964-4\n\nCreating the Kingdom of Ends; Christine Korsgaard,; Cambridge, 1996; 0-521-49962-3\n\nThe Practice of Moral Judgment; Barbara Herman; Harvard, 1993; 0-674-69718-9\n\nKantian Ethics; Allen Wood; Cambridge, 2007; 0521671140\n\nConstructions of Reason; Onora ONeil; Cambridge, 1"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "EVALUATION METHOD:  3 two-page papers, 1 seven-page and a final exam."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "TEACHING METHOD:\n The course will be organized around lectures, with plenty of time for questions and discussion."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "desc": "Learning Objectives: \nStudents will be expected to have an understanding of the basic concepts of Kant's moral theory and the relations among them, as well as knowledge of what makes a Kantian approach to moral theory distinctive."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "Department permission: email j-kasen@northwestern.edu\n\nREQUIREMENTS:  At least one prior course in philosophy"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Advanced Studies in the Philosophy of Religion", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Brook Ziporyn", "bio": null, "address": "Crowe Hall, 1860 Campus Drive, 5-159", "phone": "847 4674170", "office_hours": "TBD"}, "subject": "PHIL", "catalog_num": "366-0", "section": "20", "room": "555 Clark B03", "meeting_days": "MoWe", "start_time": "14:00:00", "end_time": "15:20:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 25, "overview": "The current culture wars tend to pit religion against atheism, in line with a tendency with a long history in European culture, where for many centuries religion was equated with theism, or monotheism, to which the only compelling alternative was a materialist or scientific secularism.     Some Asian traditions that can be characterized as both atheist and religiousfor example, Jainism, Buddhism and Daoismsuggest that this dichotomy is far from universal.   This class will examine another eruption of exceptions to this atheist/religious dichotomy, in the intellectual history of monotheist Europe itself, in the works of Baruch Spinoza.    Spinoza stands in a unique position in European intellectual history, one that resists easy categorization: regarded by some as the paradigmatic atheist, by others a rationalist theologian steeped in medieval scholasticism and \"God-intoxicated man.\"  He can be viewed as a representative Continental Rationalist situated between Descartes and Leibniz, an eccentric and only slightly heretical Jewish theologian, a prophet of mechanistic science and materialism, a signpost of the \"radical Enlightenment\" and forerunner of the French and American Revolutions, a worshipper of Nature and proto-Deep Ecologist, a Neo-Stoic virtue ethicist, an amoral hedonist philosopher of pleasure and power, a psychologist of desire and projection anticipating Freud, a mystic proponent of a monistic \"perennial philosophy,\" or, among many other thingsto use the word coined partially to fill in the categorical problem created precisely by Spinoza himselfa \"pantheist.\"   Spinoza's thought is considered difficult both for its rigorous geometric method of presentation and also for its seeming irreducibility to the usual categories, but in this course, through close reading and analysis of Spinoza's chief work, The Ethics and related texts, we will explore an understanding of his thought which accounts for all these contrary readings while also illuminating the great pleasures and excitements of grasping his unique system of thought: Spinoza as a thinker who is at once profound, revolutionary and fun.", "topic": "Spinoza", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26979, "course_id": 2638, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "FOR READING INFORMATION PLEASE EMAIL INSTRUCTOR: b-ziporyn@northwestern.edu"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "Department permission: email j-kasen@northwestern.edu"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "The Brady Scholars Program: The Good Act", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Laurie S Zoloth", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "PHIL", "catalog_num": "373-2", "section": "20", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 4-410", "meeting_days": "Mo", "start_time": "16:30:00", "end_time": "18:30:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 20, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27026, "course_id": 19271, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Philosophy of Art", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Rachel E Zuckert", "bio": null, "address": "Crowe 3-178", "phone": "8474912556\t", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "PHIL", "catalog_num": "380-0", "section": "20", "room": "University Hall 121", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "12:30:00", "end_time": "13:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 25, "overview": "CLASS DESCRIPTION: Many makers and appreciators of art have valued art as a mode of expression - whether of the artist's individuality, of emotions, or of societal values, practices, or beliefs.  In this course, we will discuss and evaluate this proposal concerning art, and investigate the concept of artistic expression.  We will discuss questions such as:  what is the value of expression, and does it exhaust the value of art?  What is the relationship of expression to beauty?  Does expression require or demonstrate authenticity or sincerity on the part of the artist?  Or can a work of art be expressive independently of the artist's state of mind, attitudes, or beliefs?  What, more generally, makes a work of art expressive?  Is expression always individualistic or is it a basis of and/or outgrowth of social community?  We will read classic expression theories of art and beauty by Thomas Reid, Leo Tolstoy, R.G.

Is it desirable to separate law and politics from our best understandings of the meaning of life?  If so, it possible to do this?  How?  Put another way, is it tyrannical for the state to enact laws on the basis of contestable normative premises?  But is it ever possible for the state not to do this?\n \nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the ideal of neutrality among contested conceptions of the good attracted many political theorists, some of whom made it a central concept in their work.  In subsequent years, it was subjected to withering critique.  Yet neutrality has a persistent appeal.  Even the most sophisticated critics of neutrality acknowledge that modern political life requires some degree of abstraction away from controversial conceptions of the good.  Almost no one regrets the state's refusal to take a position on the metaphysical status of the Eucharist.  Neutrality's continuing power demands explanation.\n \nThis class will survey the rise and fall of the ideal of neutrality, with the aim of ultimately assessing what is living and what is dead in that ideal.  It will conclude by focusing on the disestablishment of religion, which is the historical paradigm for the idea of neutrality, and use this case to consider whether neutrality can still do any useful work in the contemporary regime.", "topic": "Political Neutrality", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27030, "course_id": 2655, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "READING List with ISBNs:\nPerfectionism and Neutrality; Steven Wall & George Klosko; Rowman & Littlefield; \nISBN 0-7425-0844-7"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "EVALUATION METHOD:\nThis is a writing seminar.

John Rawls's 1971 A Theory of Justice is usually, and deservedly, given the credit for reviving Anglo-American political philosophy. But it did so in a form that an increasing number of theorists have begun to see as problematic: the focus on distributive justice in a perfectly just (\"well-ordered\") society. As a result, issues of corrective justicerectifying the injustices of our own obviously unjust societyare excluded almost by definition. But surely these are the very questions one would expect a theory of justice to be able to adjudicate. So how useful is \"ideal theory,\" really, in dealing with social oppression? Can it still serve as a long-term guide, or is it a normative dead-end? We will look at some of the growing body of literature discussing these issues, from both challengers and defenders, with a particular emphasis on matters of gender and racial injustice.", "topic": "Ideal vs. Non-Ideal Political Theory", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22651, "course_id": 16083, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "READING LIST: TBA"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "EVALUATION METHOD: One long term paper\n\n \t"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "TEACHING METHOD: Lectures + discussion"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "desc": "LEARNING OBJECTIVES: By the end of the course, the students will be expected to have become acquainted with some of the key points of the debate on ideal vs. non-ideal normative theory in political philosophy."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "INSTRUCTOR CONSENT: email jennifer-lombardo@northwestern.edu"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Seminar in Epistemology", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Baron Wayne Reed", "bio": null, "address": "Kresge 3-225", "phone": "847/467-6370", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "PHIL", "catalog_num": "468-0", "section": "20", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-345", "meeting_days": "Tu", "start_time": "16:00:00", "end_time": "18:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 15, "overview": "CLASS DESCRIPTION: This course will look at some of the most recent developments in epistemology, which are often grounded in examining the ways in which attributions of knowledge are made.

us the word utopia, or 'no place', he also pointed to the versatility of the term, now widely applied across disciplinary boundaries to advance our understanding of the 'good society'. The search for a perfect world- whether exhibited in our moral behavior or political aspiration- has traditionally opposed ills and injustices with a world of the imagination as the fanciful and the ideal as the unattainable. This freshman seminar explores the utopian ideal as embodied in literary, intellectual, political, and ideological texts that either project an image or offer reasoned conceptions of the good and perfect society throughout human history. The goal is to reconstruct the ambiguous character of the utopian ideal, which both holds out the promise of human fulfillment and has also been the source of great collective misery and human tragedy. The utopian ideal is thus considered in light of a series of questions and debates concerning human progress and its attainment. The seminar is framed around around several themes establishing the relationship between man's highest good and politics, the interplay between morality and politics, and human history and the idea of progress. In our readings we will focus on a selection of key texts from the history of political thought from the ancients to the mid-nineteenth century. Readings include Plato, Thomas More, Campanella, Bacon, Montaigne, Diderot, Montesquieu, Voltaire, Condorcet, Owen, Marx and Engels. Possible Special Events include movie screenings and visits to the Chicago Shakespeare Theatre and the Art Institute of Chicago.", "topic": "Utopia in History of Political Thought", "attributes": null, "requirements": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen and Sophomores", "component": "LEC", "class_num": 20405, "course_id": 2765, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "Reading List:\nWeek 1.

Leaders of the new nations were strongly influenced by state-centric models of development. They believed that African governments would replace colonial states with systems that promoted national unity, accelerated development, and introduced more democratic processes of governance. Instead, the post-colonial era in Africa has reflected considerable instability, divisiveness, and uncertainty. \nThe pluralist and multi-party political systems inherited by independent African governments, with a few exceptions, were replaced by military governments or single-party regimes. After 1988, spurred by economic and other developments within the continent, and major international changes such as the ending of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, sustained efforts were made to re-introduce pluralist democracies. This course will examine the successes and failures of these democratic transitions in a context of weak state structures, slow economic growth, autocratic leaders, and the mobilization of ethnic, religious, and other identities. Special attention will be devoted to pervasive and corrosive corruption in political, economic and social spheres.\nIn 2010, 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa marked their 50th years of independence from colonial rule.

It traces the emergence within Europe of a science of politics by examining how the existence of such a science came to be seen as the only way to resolve religious conflict and internecine civil war. It further seeks to establish what, in the view of early modern thinkers, the sources of human society areand which would later form the core of the so called `Enlightenment Project'by asking why has humankind chosen to live together in political societies, and whether our moral and political resources are part of our nature or only convenient conventions. The course will begin with a consideration of how the collapse of religious authority and the presence of a suddenly-discovered New World destroyed all certainty in the primacy of European conceptions of the self. It will then trace the evolution of a new definition of the human and the growing quest for a united world freed from theological foundations and based in epistemological certainty. The course is structured around several major themes: Renaissance and a New Epoch in Politics (Machiavelli); Europe's Encounter with the New World (Vitoria); Skepticism and the Quest for Certainty (Montaigne and Hobbes); Natural Law and Public Good (Locke); Social Contract Radicalized (Rousseau); Beyond Europe and the Quest for Perpetual Peace (Kant). In the process we will examine such fundamental political concepts as state sovereignty, natural law, social contract, justice and obligation.

It investigates philosophical problems concerning the kind of knowledge claims that one can advance by using those methods. The investigation is articulated primarily around problems of \"concept formation.\" \n\nThe first problem concerns the necessary historicity of the concept (e.g., \"revolution,\" \"class,\" \"property\"), i.e., the fact that the words that express the concept are themselves historically local or contingent. Insurgents in 1789 France, for example, did not understand the word \"revolution\" in the same way that we understand the word today. This observation raises the question of the concept's applicability to (or meaningfulness in) the societies being compared. Course readings investigate complex issues of translation and interpretation. \n\nThe second problem has to do with the power of the concept to reveal truth when the concept is itself historically local or contingent. The historical (political) sociologist's willingness to acquiesce in historical contingency, to advance generalizations about causal processes that are limited in their historical scope, marks a retreat from the nomothetic, transcendental ambitions of much social scientific work. This course therefore exposes students to writings in the philosophy of inquiry that argue that all knowledge, even scientific knowledge, is of necessity historically embedded. \n\nIn addition to students of comparative historical methods, this course is recommended for political theorists who work with historical texts or who are simply interested in the topics addressed: philosophy of science and hermeneutics.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27130, "course_id": 2831, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Authors read include: Gary Goertz, Karl Popper, Robert D'Amico, Thomas Kuhn, Larry Laudan, Mary Hesse, Martha Howell, Georg Iggers, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Peter Winch, Jean Grondin, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricur, Pierre Bourdieu, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "Grading is based on a final exam that prepares students for prelims.

The class will evaluate as well how to understand the relation between form and content in establishing knowledge in works of fiction, legal evidence, films, and scholarly books and articles.   Class texts will include the Bible, Plato, Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, Arendt, the television show, \"Lie to Me,\" empirical studies of \"lie detectors,\" and recent scholarship on \"counter-factual narratives.\"", "topic": "The Politics of Truth and Lies", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27661, "course_id": 2862, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "TBA"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Responsible Conduct of Research Training", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "James L Mahoney", "bio": "James Mahoney is a comparative-historical researcher with interests in socioeconomic development, political regimes, and methodology.

Ultimately, the goal of this course is to impart an initial understanding of some fundamentals of human nature and behavior, as well as instill a deeper appreciation for the science of psychology. To this end, 10 hours of laboratory experience are required across the quarter to allow you to have first-hand experience of the way research is conducted in psychology.

This is not a comparative religions course, we will not focus extensively on the formal religious traditions.  Instead, we will be thinking and talking about life situations in which humans articulate an understanding of the meaning of their lives in relationship to something that we might choose to call \"religion.\"  The major themes explored in relation to the problems of \"religion,\" \"human,\" and \"experience\" will be sexuality, death, demons, and youth.  We will explore these themes in different contexts and communities across time and space.

The Talmud is an unusual work of literature, and it has been credited as an influence on codes of law, sermons, modern works of Jewish literature, and even Seinfeld. This course will explain the Talmud's import and durability within Jewish culture while introducing students to the rigors of legal analysis that lie at the heart of most talmudic passages. The course is ideal for those interested in religion, law, logic games and questions of textual interpretation. The course will study the Talmud entirely in English translation; there is neither a language prerequisite nor an expectation of prior experience reading the Talmud.", "topic": "Reading Talmud in Translation", "attributes": "SoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26973, "course_id": 2259, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "1) Course Packet (TBA)\n2) Christine E.

Meanwhile, its business model, which integrated early forms of \"convergence\" and \"transmedia storytelling\" long before they became fashionable, is likewise viewed with as much respect for its innovations and it is criticized for its detrimental cultural and global impact. Yet, historically, the company's success is frequently misunderstood: Disney thrived in the long run not because of artistic brilliance, but because of a remarkable ability to exploit technological innovations in the medium of film and, later, television, home video and digital cinema. While Disney's (often accidental) innovation in advertising and promotion was also a key factor, the company also consistently found ways to maximize and market technological novelty over anything elseand often with mixed critical and commercial results. What role did Disney play in advancements in feature-length animation? The mixture of live-action and animation? The newer medium of television? Big budget blockbusters? The rise of home video formats? Computer-generated imagery? What strategies of self-promotion did Disney use to exploit these developments? How did Disney benefit from industrial and/or artistic collaboration with others (the US Federal Government, the American Broadcast Company, Pixar Studios, etc.)? How did Disney's innovations compare and/or contrast with other companies and studios at the time?

Even mainstream multiplexes were showcasing movies such as David Fincher's Fight Club, Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich, Alexander Payne's Election, David O. Russell's Three Kings and numerous others that were directed by talented filmmakers ranging from new up-and-comers like Sofia Coppola and Sam Mendes, to established veterans such as Martin Scorsese and Stanley Kubrick. Reflecting on this new post-Sundance generation of \"independent\"-minded American filmmakers at the dawn of the new Millennium, film journalist James Mottram asked rhetorically if \"we are returning to an age where formerly independent directors are using studio funds to further their own idiosyncratic vision?\" A decade later, such speculation remains provocative and fruitful, but also idyllic and nostalgic. Mottram and others imagine the late 1990s as a moment in Hollywood where filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, David Fincher, Wes Anderson, and others revived the auteurist legacies of the French New Wave and the New Hollywood of the 1970sthe retrospective perception that directors enjoyed unprecedented creative freedom. Two recent books, Mottram's The Sundance Kids and Susan Waxman's Rebels on the Backlot, documented this distinctive period in Hollywood history, and bothin very different waysfocused on the romantic ideal of the director repeatedly fighting the studio system for their own idiosyncratic vision. How much of this narrative is rooted in verifiable industrial events, and how much of it is rooted in old-fashioned auteurist critical projection? How much may be a product of both? In what ways did these filmmakers fight for \"their\" vision, and to what extent did they generally collaborate with studios on mutually affirming commercial and critical goals? The approach to authorship in this course will be as much historical as aesthetic, focusing on the influx of young filmmakers into Hollywood during a post-Pulp Fiction, pre-Lord of the Rings moment, when several idiosyncratic writers and directors gained increased creative freedom and provided the industry with distinctive, if also modest, artistic innovation. The emphasis will be on how these filmmakers collectively suggest a period of transition in Hollywood at the end of the 20th Century, rather than emphasizing the stylistic and thematic tendencies of particular figures. We will look in particular at a five-year span, from 1994 to 1999, and at filmmakers working loosely within the intersection between mainstream Hollywood production, the Sundance independent scene, and \"art cinema.\"", "topic": "American Directors of 1990s", "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27325, "course_id": 4353, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Susan Waxman, Rebels on the Backlot (Harper, 2005), ISBN: 0060540184; James Mottram, The Sundance Kids (Faber & Faber, 2007), ISBN: 0865479674."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "The grade will be based on written responses, exams, a research paper, and active participation."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "Lecture will be discussion-oriented, focused directly on issues raised by the assigned readings and screenings."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "desc": "By the end of the term, you should be able to: 1) discuss several individual filmmakers and films from this period in American cinema, as well as possible overlaps in their stylistic and thematic tendencies; 2) articulate the industrial and cultural factors in their rhizomatic moments of success (as well as failure); 3) reflect on the differences and similarities between various modes of film production and distribution, such as independent film, studio fare and art cinema; 4) analyze the implications of contemporary American film on representations of gender, class, race and history; 5) recognize formal visual and aural strategies that narrative filmmakers use when constructing a cinematic story."}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Studies in Radio/Tv/Film Authorship", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Jacob Arnaud Smith", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "RTVF", "catalog_num": "321-0", "section": "20", "room": "Helmerich Auditorium", "meeting_days": "MoWe", "start_time": "13:00:00", "end_time": "14:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 25, "overview": "We know very well that films are collaborative projects: when we see the credits\nroll at the end of a major film, there are hundreds of names and numerous\nspecialized tasks. And yet the idea of an individual creator still has a powerful\nhold over the way most of us think about and experience the media. What does it mean\nto be an \"author\" in the cultural industries? What is the nature of creative work in\nthe media? How is a media artist's reputation constructed and understood? What role\ndo critics and audiences play in that process? Why are some media texts \"authored\"\nand others aren't? How does collaboration work in the cultural industries? In this\ncourse we will investigate these and other questions through the analysis of the\ntransmedia career of David Lynch.\n\nLynch's output covers a remarkably wide range of production contexts and media\nforms. Lynch is, in many ways, the ultimate crossover artist: an underground cult\nfilmmaker who became the only director to have a hit network television show the\nsame year as winning the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. Beginning as a\npainter, he emerged as an avant-garde filmmaker in the early 1970s. After Eraserhead\nachieved the status of a cult classic on the \"midnight movie\" circuit, Lynch jumped\ninto mainstream filmmaking, and has become one of the rare directors to find success\nboth with general audiences and academics, and films such as Blue Velvet became\ntouchstones for discussions of film theory in the 1980s. Lynch has never been\nwithout critics, and has come under fire for his depiction of women, minorities and\nsexual violence. Lynch has often had a remarkable degree of control over his\nprojects, and yet worked in close collaboration with Alan Splet and Angelo\nBadalamenti, both of whom played a key role in providing the enigmatic sound design\nand distinctive use of music found in Lynch's work. Lynch's career has developed at\nthe crossroads of film and television, as well as of art cinema and popular culture.\nMost recently, Lynch has applied his distinctive approach to digital media, making\nshort films for his website, and exploring digital cinematography for his latest\nfeature, Inland Empire. Lynch serves then, as a useful nexus point for a\nconsideration of issues of media authorship, the nature of collaboration and\ncreativity in the cultural industries, the cultures of art house and mainstream\nfilm, the differing logics of film, television, and digital media, the importance of\nsound design in the media, the representation of race and gender in both Hollywood\nand avant-garde film, and a range of other issues.", "topic": "Meet David Lynch", "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27323, "course_id": 4353, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Course Reading Pack (Quartet Copies)\n\nChris Rodley ed.

Thus, when we say a film is \"nostalgic,\" the criticism implies a movie that sentimentalizes a utopic vision of public and/or private histories. Yet in her remarkable book, The Future of Nostalgia (2001), Svetlana Boym argues that there are many different forms of nostalgianot only the most reactionary types which attempt to preserve the illusion of a simpler time, but also ones founded on more complicated questions: how does an affection for the past problematize our relationship to it? How does it organize our relationship to the present? Or the future? In this course, we will watch and discuss a range of films which reflect on, and interrogate, the question of nostalgia as both a narrative and a meta-textual issue. In other words, we will consider not only films that represent nostalgia directly or indirectly, but also films thatthrough their own (re-)circulationspeak to industrial, transmedia and/or audience notions of nostalgia. Films viewed will range from the classic (Vertigo, Last Year at Marienbad, Wild Strawberries) to the contemporary (Lost in Translation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), and involve various genres, such the Western (The Wild Bunch), science-fiction (Star Trek II) and comedy (National Lampoon's Vacation). In addition to viewing and discussing how these films present and problematize various personal, cultural, industrial and historical questions concerning nostalgia, we will also spend substantial time analyzing the respective work of authors (Boym, Fredric Jameson, Susan Sontag, Paul Grainge, Pam Cook, and so forth) who offer fascinating theorizations on the relationship between film and nostalgia. Some more questions we may consider include: how do films \"represent\" nostalgia? Do they offer images of an idealized past, or do they explore a character(s)' own struggle with nostalgia? How do movies negotiate nostalgia for a genre, a franchise, or a star? How does cinematic nostalgia affect public and private understandings of history?

Some of these will ask you to\ndiscuss a particular aspect of an assigned reading, or apply a course concept to\nyour own experience or another media text, etc. These will be assigned IN THE\nLECTURE and will ALWAYS be due as a hard copy in class. RESPONSE PAPERS WILL NOT BE\nACCEPTED LATE OR VIA EMAIL. Because extenuating circumstances may mean that a\nstudent is genuinely forced to miss classes and so might miss a response paper\nassignment, the one response paper for which you receive the lowest mark will not be\ncounted in your final assessment. It is expected that if you are forced to miss a\nclass session, you will get any missed assignments from your fellow classmates.\nShort, unannounced reading quizzes will also help to motivate students to stay on\ntop of the reading load.\nThere will be two exams that amount to 60% of your total grade in the class. Exams\nwill cover material from class readings, lectures and discussions.

Films produced by Corman were\nfamed not just for turning a profit or for delivering thrills and chills, but for\ntheir resourceful storytelling and formal strategies, their humor, and for their\nengagement with contemporary political issues and anxieties with unexpected\nintelligence (and without the kid gloves of \"good taste\" demanded by Hollywood films\nand TV of the time).

While such films cover a wide range of subjects and modes--including research films, educational films, and industrial or \"sponsored\" films--this heterogeneous realm of film history is united by a set of research challenges that pose unique methodological issues for media scholars. Often \"orphaned\" by their producers after they have served their usually ephemeral purpose, these films are scattered in a variety of collections and formats, usually without any accompanying paper documentation. Moreover, these films allow us to think about the moving image beyond theoretical and historical frameworks dominated by the theatrical feature film. This course, then, will outline the theoretical and methodological challenges of writing a history of \"useful film.\" \n\nThe course is open only to graduate students; class size is limited to 15.

Climate change is arguably the most hotly debated, if not the most prominent, topic of our day.  Much of this debate focuses on climate change as a scientific problem: the physics of the greenhouse effect, the global carbon cycle, future climate forecasts, and scientific uncertainty.  This course focuses instead on climate change as a social problem, one with both human roots and a significant human impact.  Re-conceptualizing climate change a social problem raises questions often neglected in public debate.  Most basicallyhow do particular forms of social organization and practice contribute to climate change?  Less obviously but equally importantlyhow is climate change impacting social organization and cultural practices?  Finally, how have various groups responded to climate change and climate-related effects?   These three questions serve as the foundation for this course.  In addition, this course uses the case of climate change to explore a number of topics of broader sociological interest: how we define the boundary between nature and culture, the relationship between science and politics, the role of science and scientific experts in social movements, and questions of environmental justice.  Successful completion of this course will provide students with not only a basic introduction to sociology, but also exposure to central debates in environmental sociology, social movements, and the sociology of science and technology.

We will discuss the different meanings of work and occupations; impact of work on individuals and societies; organizational contexts and social relations of work; work as an instrument of social inequality (race, class, gender, national origin, etc.) and its consequences for society exemplified by the contemporary living wage movement. Why do professionals tend to command higher social standing than the working class in society? And how do we as individuals go about seeking and securing a fulfilling work life? We will also examine how technology has transformed work at various stages of human history- from the era of hunting and gathering to present day computer-based production, distribution and service delivery characteristic of the new American workplace. \n\tThe impact of the global economy on work is as important as the structure and process of work at the domestic level. Because societies are no longer islands unto themselves and bearing in mind the phenomena of outsourcing, sweat shops and fair trade, we address the questions: How has globalization impacted American workers and the American workplace? Who benefits from, and who looses to, the interaction between work and the global economy? We will try to understand these elements of work through relevant readings, lectures, and class discussions. Videos on work and quality of work life will be used to make the readings and lectures more vivid.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Social & Behavioral Sciences Distro Area\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27686, "course_id": 3337, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Robert Perrucci & C.

A common story often goes that an idea springs forth from the mind of a genius, who single-handedly invents and transforms our world. Yet, when we look more closely at innovations and their effects, we see that technologies and societies are interwoven in complex processes of sociotechnical change. Technologies, developed through group efforts and built on socially produced systems of standardization, are social constructions shaped by a wide array of powerful actors, social movements, and cultural influences, often through controversy. Meanwhile, what it means to be a human being is continually reshaped by the development of our technologies. In this course, we will use sociological approaches to explore these complex relationships of technology and society.

We will also watch a number of films to see how Cuban cinema has explored these issues in visual and well as narrative terms.

After taking a glimpse at contemporary Argentine Jewish life in Daniel Burman's film Family Law (2007) and discussing questions concerning Latin American Jewish literature more broadly, we will turn to the work of Gerchnoff, the \"founding father\" of the  Argentine-Jewish tradition.  We will read The Jewish Gauchos (1910), which is set in a Jewish agricultural colony at the beginning of the twentieth century, when large numbers of Eastern European Jews began emigrating to the Americas. We will then turn to several works of fiction and essay (1930s-1940s) by Borges, who, though not Jewish, has been called a \"Jewish writer.\" Timerman's testimonial narrative Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number (1980) gives an account of the author's imprisonment during the Dirty War and Shua's humorous novel The Book of Memories (1994) tells the story of three generations of a Jewish family living in Buenos Aires.  We will then return to Burman's representation of modern-day Jewish experience in his  semi-autobiographical film Lost Embrace (2003), which presents life in the Jewish neighborhood of \"Once\" in contemporary Buenos Aires.

An on-site field experience, readings, and guest speakers will enrich this course as participants explore community organizations, structures for working with schools and teachers, and teaching in nontraditional settings.

We will analyze the work of performance artists, playwrights, and companies alongside the theoretical work of scholars in theatre, performance, and gender studies.  This will enable us to consider how feminist theories and feminist performance practices have informed one another.\n\n \n\n\"Practice\" signals both the content and the form of our inquiry.  We will consider the practices of others while experimenting with those practices and developing our own.  How can we use feminist theories in theatrical practice?  How can performance inform theories of gender and sexuality?  How can we use performance as a tool for political, social, and cultural engagement?  The content, instruction, and assignments of the course are designed to explore the relationship between scholarship and practice.  In addition to more traditional coursework in the humanities (reading and writing), this course requires that you put your ideas into action.

Structure and Production Process\n\nOver the centuries, theatre has been produced and performed in various different formats and social frameworks, from the Dionysian Festivals of ancient Athens and the sharing companies of Elizabethan England to high school musicals and the Metropolitan Opera. In the contemporary U.S., professional theatre is primarily produced by non-profit regional theatres and commercial production companies. Over the course of the quarter, students will explore how the organizational structures of theatre companiesthe relationships between artists, funding agencies, government bodies, private donors, trusties, season ticket holders, etc.influence the ways in which theatre is created and presented to the public. Guest speakers from organizations such as the Actors' Equity Association and the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs will share their insights with the class, as will theatre artists who can relate their personal experiences working within different organizational frameworks. After surveying historical models of theatre production, students will examine the structures of contemporary American companies and explore how various interest groups influence their creative processes and the artistic outcomes.\n\nThe final for the course will be a group project, in which the class surveys the Chicago theatre scene. Each student will contribute one case study, describing a theatre company's sources of funding, organizational structure, production practices, and artistic and organizational goals based on interviews with members of a local theatre company.", "topic": "Theatre Organizations", "attributes": "No P/N option for this section\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 25044, "course_id": 4665, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "History of the Lyric Theatre", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Dominic E Missimi", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "THEATRE", "catalog_num": "367-0", "section": "20", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-380", "meeting_days": "MoWeFr", "start_time": "13:00:00", "end_time": "13:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 50, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27545, "course_id": 4666, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Latin American Theatre", "term": "2011 Winter", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Katherine Anne Zien", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "THEATRE", "catalog_num": "369-0", "section": "20", "room": "Parkes Hall 224", "meeting_days": "Mo", "start_time": "14:00:00", "end_time": "16:50:00", "start_date": "2011-01-03", "end_date": "2011-03-12", "seats": 20, "overview": "This course will examine the ways that theatre and performance artists\nhave approached controversies and politics attending the transnational\nflow of people, goods, and contraband throughout the Americas.
