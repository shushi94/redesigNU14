On a global scale, Western societies have been largely responsible for developing economic institutions, religious identities, international laws and nation-states mobilized through `race' and historically shaped by racism. Yet at the same time, western cultures have globally represented themselves as exemplars of liberalism, democracy, civilization and universalism. The objective of the course therefore is to develop an effective conceptual and historical understanding of the formative processes and discourses involved in constructing western modernity as a series of racialized polities, cultures and societies. Consequently, this is not a course overly concerned with empirical case studies or attitudinal assessments; it promotes a thinking approach rather than a descriptive one.

The course works its way through these questions by reflecting on the meaning of postcoloniality as a way of reading the contemporary post-civil rights era. At the same time it questions whether African American studies itself has sufficiently absorbed the critical meaning of post-colonialism in order to understand the persistence of coloniality and racism in the modern western world, despite the formal ending of colonialism and racial segregation. This involves subjecting to critique prevailing nationalist and historicist accounts in African American studies with regard to politics, culture, social structure and identity, in order to situate discussion around the neglected themes of globalization, Eurocentrism and Black cosmopolitanisms, each of which is taken to highlight the significance of a postcolonial approach to African American studies.

For example, women in many societies may hold the status of a wife and a husband, depending on the situation. Male religious practitioners may be referred to as wives of the deities they represent and dress as women. \n\nModern African women live in worlds of accelerated change, historically conditioned in turn by indigenous state building, colonialism, nationalism, independence, \"modern\" development, and globalization. Many of their beliefs are grounded in traditional values and kinship dynamics. They have always played prominent roles in religious observance, staging rituals, community and state leadership, family life, and economic production. While they have strengthened traditional practices, they have also led the way in indigenizing outside influences (Islam, Christianity, and Asian religions) to create vibrant new forms of associational life, economic organization, and popular culture.", "topic": "Gender in African Society", "attributes": "SoComm Additional Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 36940, "course_id": 8702, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Lynn M.

We will look at the spectacular archaeological remains of the Pompeii site that was buried by volcanic ash preserving a record of the details of the daily lives of its Roman inhabitants. We will compare the archaeology of Pompeii with Roman literary and architectural sources that describe Roman everyday life. \n\nThe final section of the class will look at the ancient Maya in the 7th century AD.

Emerging paradigms will be examined, such as the superceding of images by information, and of art exhibition by communication and media platforming. We will consider some of the different ways that artists handle information and new media and technology, for example how they have appropriated relatively new forms like networks and databases. The social and technological changes associated with globalization and the artistic responses to such changes will lead us to track shifts in art's relationship to audiences and culture at large, and to question the relevance today of distinctions between high and low, margin and mainstream. With these developments as our framework, we will then review and update notions of modernism and postmodernism in the visual arts, and question the status today of more traditional media like painting and sculpture, as well as re-evaluate the idea of the avant-garde and its long-held desire to merge art and life.  \nNo prerequisites.

How does Siu Sin Far use sentimentalism as a strategy to evoke empathy for her mixed race protagonists? How does Hirahara manipulate conventions of literary noir to contest dominant recollections of WWII?  \n\nThus we are also learning to `deconstruct' the text and understand how Asian American literature and culture offers a parallax view into American history, culture and political-economy.

The Armenian diaspora, for instance, is one of the oldest and widest diasporas in the world. Displacement of people from Palestine, on the other hand, is a more recent phenomenon, motivated by current political factors. In comparison, immigration from India or China often arises from a quest for better education or economic opportunities. While these differences are crucial, examining diaspora out of the various parts of Asia allows for the development of larger contexts that can frame the sociological and cultural aspects of diaspora. This course uses film as an important cultural artifact to discuss the various aspects of Asian Diasporas to North America. The aim is to ground these discussions in theory, but also to frame them against the historical context these films arise from, thereby fleshing out the nuances of life in diaspora, while still being able to maintain some of the common experiential grounds of Asian American migration.", "topic": "Cinema in Asian Diasporas", "attributes": "SoComm Humanities/Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 33458, "course_id": 15471, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Ankori, Gannit. 2003.

Such problems, which are becoming increasingly common and increasingly urgent, challenge traditional management thinking, assumptions and approaches.\n\n\"Wicked Problems\" are distinguished by having a high level of complexity and even volatility, often with limited data to support analysis and decision-making. Change-resistant legacies and multiple stakeholders with widely-varying agendas add to the challenge.

We will continue with our study of chemical equilibria, focusing on common equilibrium systems in aqueous solutions: acids, bases, buffers and complex ions. We will follow this with a study of electrochemistry, defining the components of electrochemical cells, determining whether a cell can produce electrical work, and explaining certain industrial and biological processes in terms of electrochemical principles. This will be followed by an introduction to chemical kinetics, including factors affecting the rates of chemical reactions, experimental approaches to determining reaction rates, and the use of kinetic data in determining reaction mechanisms.

While its arrival on the scene is already impacting materials science and molecular nanotechnology, it is also providing a new lease of life to chemical synthesis where mechanical bond formation occurs as a consequence of the all-important templation orchestrated by molecular recognition and self-assembly processes. The way in which covalent bond formation activates noncovalent bonding interactions, switching on molecular recognition that leads to self-assembly and the template-directed synthesis of mechanically interlocked moleculesof which the so-called catenanes and rotaxanes may be regarded as the prototypeshas introduced a level of integration into chemical synthesis that has not previously been attained. The challenge now is to carry this level of integration beyond relatively small molecules into the realms of precisely functionalized extended molecular structures and aggregated superstructures that perform functions in a collective manner as the key sources of instruction, activation and performance in multi-component integrated devices.\n\nIn this course I will propose the adoption of the term mechanostereochemistry to describe the rapidly emerging area of chemical science where components of molecules and extended structures are mechanically interlocked or sterically encumbered in such a manner that the components interact dynamically with one another as a result of a panoply of weak noncovalent bonds and/or as a consequence of dynamic coordinative or covalent bonds. Mechanostereochemistry is the stereochemistry of molecules with mechanical bonds. The practice of mechanostereochemistry can be seen to have both a creative aspect (molecular recognition, self-assembly, templation, etc.) and a functional role (relative movements of components, switching, self-energizing, etc.) associated with its territory. Both the creative aspect and the functional role are dynamic in nature and ultimately molecular in context. The conundrum facing the wider chemical community at present is to unravel how to get from relatively small, yet highly programmable molecules to contraptions and gadgets that do something useful in the real world. \n\n\"Big and Little Meccano\" Tetrahedron 2008, 64, 8231-8263.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 32724, "course_id": 1495, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Advanced Organic Chemistry", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Alexander Vladimirovich Statsyuk", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "CHEM", "catalog_num": "415-0", "section": "23", "room": "Technological Institute L221", "meeting_days": "MoWeFr", "start_time": "09:00:00", "end_time": "09:50:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 25, "overview": null, "topic": "Bio-organic Chemistry", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37336, "course_id": 1495, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Advanced Inorganic Chemistry", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Merkouri G Kanatzidis", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "CHEM", "catalog_num": "435-0", "section": "20", "room": "Technological Institute M345", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "12:20:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 25, "overview": null, "topic": "Solid State Chemistry", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37337, "course_id": 1498, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Elementary Statistical Mechanics", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Neil Stanley Snider", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "CHEM", "catalog_num": "444-0", "section": "01", "room": "Technological Institute L158", "meeting_days": "MoWeFr", "start_time": "08:00:00", "end_time": "08:50:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 22, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 32425, "course_id": 1505, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "\"Elementary Statistical Mechanics\" by Donald McQuarrie, 2nd, 2000 edition"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Computational Chemistry", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Tamar Seideman", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "CHEM", "catalog_num": "448-0", "section": "01", "room": "Technological Institute L221", "meeting_days": "MoWeFr", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "11:50:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 25, "overview": "This course is concerned with the application of modern computer technology, in combination with theoretical chemistry methods, to chemical problems.

While most Cynics leave us no writings, we have many descriptions of their entertaining behavior and provocative views, a selection of which we shall read.\n \nThe Cynics have been overlooked in Anglo-American philosophy of late, but Diogenes was an inspiration to many important thinkers over the centuries.  In the ancient world the Stoic philosophers were often Cynical; scholars debate how far early Christianity (or even Jesus himself) was influenced by `the Dogs'.

The daunting complexity of the brain, the remarkable\nflexibility of human thought, and the apparent paradox of a brain being able to understand itself have combined to make this goal elusive.  However, in recent years, a set of promising new ways of approaching the study of the mind have emerged as a result of two forces: (1) the interaction and collaboration of scientists studying cognition in a variety of disciplines, and (2) the advent of computers, which make it possible to build testable models (in the form of computer programs) of various aspects of intelligence. The fields of cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, philosophy, anthropology, and neuroscience have all contributed to these endeavors, and the result has come to be known as cognitive science -- the interdisciplinary study of\nthe mind.\nThis course focuses on three main areas: learning, knowledge representation, and reasoning. Some of the issues we explore are the nature of concepts and how they are acquired and used; how experiences are stored in memory and what determines when they are retrieved; how children's minds develop into adult minds, and how this compares to what happens when adults learn a new domain. We will cover current research on whether the language we speak affects the way we think and discuss new findings on animal cognition.  The goal of the course is not merely to survey research in these areas, but rather to explore current theories and to describe the evidence - psychological, computational, and linguistic - that supports or challenges them.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Social & Behavioral Sciences Distro Area\n\nAttendance at 1st class mandatory\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 32406, "course_id": 2979, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Current textbook in Cognitive Science plus readings on current topics."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "Weekly homeworks plus two in-class examinations."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "Twice-weekly lecture and discussion."}], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Theories of Persuasion", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Daniel James O'Keefe", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "COMM_ST", "catalog_num": "205-0", "section": "20", "room": "Frances Searle Building 1441", "meeting_days": "MoWe", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "11:50:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 80, "overview": "Survey of major theories that explain how to change another person's attitudes and behaviors.

The first objective is to try to understand how and why \"democracy\" today has come to be regarded as the only \"legitimate\" form of government.   \nThis was not always the case.  After the brief and dramatic appearance more than two thousand years ago in the ancient Greece, \"democracy\" was regarded more often negatively as a dangerous and unstable form of government.  However, since the late eighteenth century (after the two great revolutions, the American and the French), especially after 1945 (after the second WW), democracy has had spectacular ascent as the only viable and legitimate form of \"self-governance\" and as an expression of \"popular sovereignty.\"   It now dominates both our political speech and imagination. How did this happen?  Is the world and nation-states that organize the world politically and territorially, so diverse culturally and so uneven in terms of economic development, ready for democracy?  \n\nThe second objective is to understand how alternative roads to modernity and democratic polity taken by different countries after the decolonization process began in the second half of the 20th century is profoundly shaped by cultures and histories of those countries.  The course hopes to address questions such as: What are the conditions that make for stable democracies?  Why does it take root here (i.e., India) and not there (i.e., Pakistan)?  How does alternative roads to modernity, both reception of and resistance to modernity in a given country, affect the prospects of democracy?   The course aims at a comparative understanding of modernities and democracies\n\nThe third, the most important, objective is to focus on the dialectic of voice (rhetoric) and violence in contemporary democracies. The traditional common place that \"voice\" replaces \"violence\" or persuasion obviates \"force\" in democratic societies is no longer true.

Yehoshua, Aharon Appelfeld, David Grossman, Shulamith Hareven, Ya'aqov Shabtai , Yoel Hoffman and Orly Castel-Bloom.\n\nAll texts are in English translation and the course presupposes no prior knowledge of Hebrew, Jewish history or literaturethough such knowledge is, of course, welcomed!\n\nQuestions to be addressed include:\n\nWhat is the place of  Modern Israeli Literature in the Jewish literary canon?\n\nWhy is there so much tension between the presentation of Israel by Israeli writers and Israel as conceived of by American Jews?\n\nWhy is this \"insider\" view of Israel so little taken into account of in the omnipresent and incessant political debate surrounding Israel?\n\nWhat is the relationship between Jewish culture as it is evolving in Israel and Jewish culture in the Diaspora?

Beginning in 1910, as he lived through the tumultuous events of Japan's modernization, its tragic imperial expansion until defeat in World War II, and its astonishing recovery in the 1950s and 1960, he created rich, lush, ironic fictional worlds, where sexual and cultural obsession directed and ruled the lives of the men and women in his stories. Through it all, Japanese society was dealing with public issues both positive and negative that still concern itand ustoday; we see those efforts as well as intensely private concerns in Tanizaki's often perverse but always entertaining stories.  Tanizaki's writings covered not just the modern world he lived in, but also went back as far as the 10th century for inspiration, in mixtures of history and fantasy, contemporary life and \"visions of desire\" (in Ken Ito's evocative phrase).  Even landscapes that look like ones we live in achieve a special luster and color in his masterful writing.  Before his death, Tanizaki was being mentioned for the Nobel Prize in literature.  This course offers the chance to get to know well a major twentieth-century writer through some of his most distinguished work available in translation, to judge for ourselves whether his writing achieved the deep humanistic substantiality expected of a Nobel laureate.

Our class will consider questions like the following:\n\n<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve been here for two quarters, which parts of Northwestern are you familiar with? Do any feel like \"home\"? Which parts have you heard about but still don&rsquo;t know?\n<ul>\n<li>What makes someone feel included or excluded from a community?\n<li>What does being part of the \"Northwestern Community\" mean to you? \n<li>Is \"community\" a vibrant force at Northwestern, or is it something you believe we&rsquo;re lacking? \n<li>What do you mean (think, feel) when you describe yourself as a \"Northwestern student\"? \n</ul>\n\n<p>At the same time, we will explore how people write about place, community and identity. To start, we will focus on description and narration, looking at NU as a place (and our place). Then we will use a variety of readings to define \"community,\" examine how community shapes (or fails to shape) notions of self, and explore what it means to be excluded from a community and whether it&rsquo;s difficult to re-enter a community one has left. In this segment of the course we&rsquo;ll think about students but also veterans, expatriates, and former prisoners. Finally, to gain a fuller picture of Northwestern, we will use interviews, surveys, and site visits to investigate other students&rsquo; opinions about Northwestern and to explore different residence halls, schools, campus organizations and our professional schools in Chicago.

These double names can be traced back to 1066, when the Frenchspeaking Normans, led by William the Bastard, conquered England and installed their countrymen in almost every position of power. In the aftermath of this victory, William the Bastard became William the\nConqueror and cows and pigs and sheep became <i>beef</i> and <i>pork</i> and <i>mutton</i> - after they were killed and cooked and served up to the Normans at their banquets. Like many other high-falutin' words in English, these animal names all derive from French.

As we discuss the themes and techniques in specific texts in the context of contemporary global literary theories, we will examine and problematize terms such as \"cultural translation\", \"poetics of relation\", \"modernity\", \"modernization\", \"abrogation\", \"writing back\" and \"postcoloniality\" in the context of postcolonial theory.", "topic": "Postcolonial Poetics/Lives", "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\nSoComm Humanities/Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 33732, "course_id": 1834, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "Post 1798.

In an era of globalization, when new technologies of travel and communication have transformed our perception of the distances that separate people and places, ostensibly diminishing the spaces between, do homes take on a greater sense of importance, or are they more portable, translatable, and reproducible?  In short, we will explore American literature through the local, national, and transnational frameworks that are created and contested through the act of migration.

The result was a series of works of various genres: essays, novels, and journalistic accounts of their visit and what happened in Rwanda during the 100 days of 1994. \n\nWhile the writers participating in the Rwanda project were all non-Rwandan, in the past few years fictional accounts by Rwandan writers have been published. These literary accounts were preceded by a number of memoirs by Rwandans and in particular by women survivors. We will read several of these texts and will compare their strategies of storytelling with the Rwanda project novels.  \n\nOne of the writers participating in the Rwanda project was the preeminent Senegalese novelist Boubacar Boris Diop. Since the publication of his acclaimed novel, <em>Murambi, le livre des ossements</em>, in 2000, Diop has remained active in Rwanda and has been involved in several artistic projects. He will be the guest of the French department for some time during the quarter and will appear to two of our sessions, giving us the unique opportunity to discuss with him the Rwanda project, his novel, and what is going on currently in Rwanda. To prepare for this discussion, students will be required to read newspaper reports on current debates in and on Rwanda.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\nPrerequisites apply, see description\n\nSoComm Humanities/Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37284, "course_id": 15862, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "<ul><li>Josias Semujanga \"Rcits fondateurs du drame rwandais\" (selections - essay)</li>\n<li>Josias Semujanga \"De la construction du Hamite  la mise  mort du Tutsi\"</li>\n<li>Jean-Pierre Chrtien et Grard Prunier <em>Les thnies ont une histoire</em> (selections)</li>\n<li>Boubacar Boris Diop <em>Murambi, le livre des ossements</em></li>\n<li>Jean Hatzfeld <em>Dans le nu de la vie</em></li>\n<li>Walter Benjamin \"De la violence\"</li>\n<li><em>Parler des camps, penser les gnocides</em> (selections)</li>\n<li>Yolande Mukagasana <em>La mort ne veut pas de moi</em></li>\n<li>Tiero Monnembo <em>L'an des orphelins</em></li>\n<li>Gilbert Gatore <em>Le pass devant soi</em></li>\n<li>Robert Genoud <em>Rwanda: How History Can Lead to Genocide</em> (Film)</li>\n<li>Ann Aghion, <em>My Neighbor, My Killer</em> (Film)</li>\n<li><em>God Sleeps in Rwanda</em> (Film)</li>\n<li><em>Through My Eyes: A Film About Rwandan Youth</em> (Film)</li></ul>"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "French 271-0, French 272-0, French 273-0, or consent of instructor"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "The Novel in French", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Scott Joseph Hiley", "bio": null, "address": "1860 S.

In addition to the IS work, we consider both the relation of Debord's thought to the social and political theorists in conversation with whom it developed (Marx, Lukcs, and the avant-garde art movements) and major contemporary critical engagements with Debord, including those of Agamben, Jappe, and Beller.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Read & Discuss in language\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37290, "course_id": 3071, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "Graduate standing.

From The Birth of Tragedy (1872) to The Gay Science (1882/1887) and Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883-1885) through to Twilight of the Idols (1888), Nietzsche approaches the question of what life is in a variety of different ways and offers to his readers multiple accounts that, taken all together, resist being easily assembled into a coherent system. Not only do conceptual difficulty and the unavoidable question of style raise formidable challenges to getting a grip on Nietzsche's idea of life; there is also the fact that Nietzsche's views on this topic were constantly developing and so any effort to understand what he meant when he wrote about life must reckon with this variability. \n\tThis course will take on the problem of life in Nietzsche's thought, but on a smaller, more tractable scale.

It introduces the feminist political philosophy classics as responses to those traditions (we read excerpts from figures such as Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Harriet Taylor, Friedrich Engels, Simone de Beauvoir, Carole Pateman). One focus of the course considers the way in which traditional claims to rights, freedom and political futures were also based on the exclusion of a number of groups. How have the leading traditions subsequently been reworked to include previously excluded groups? Have interesting paradoxes and inconsistencies arisen in rights discourse as a result? From the perspective of this question, we consider how contemporary political theorists have taken up such issues as justice and the family, pornography, prostitution, surrogacy contracts, and the 'politics of the veil' in the public sphere.

In particular, we consider the challenges to an idealized view of the Victorian woman as a selfless and submissive wife and mother by exploring the contentious debates that erupted over issues like marriage, the independent woman, birth control, and prostitution, and the sometimes unorthodox choices women made in order to escape a dependant existence at home. These issues are contextualized throughout by reference to the huge disparity between the comfortable middle classes and the poor, and the appalling social conditions of an urban underclass.

Within fourteen years, the Weimar Republic had collapsed and been replaced by Hitler and the Nazis, heralding in twelve of the most brutal and horrific years in the history of Europe, including the second world war to engulf the continent in less than a generation.  More than half a century later, the memories of Weimar and the Nazis continue to exert enormous influence upon European and world politics and memory.  This course examines German social, economic, political, and cultural developments between 1918 and 1945, focusing on the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich as distinct but intimately connected chapters in German history.  The first part of the course examines the history of Weimar from its origins in the ruins of the First World War to its sudden and ignoble death in 1933.  Specifically, this portion asks in what ways the Republic's origins influenced its subsequent history and demise.  How did the economic and political situation of Weimar lead to the rise of Nazism?  The second part of the course covers the Nazi period.  How did the Nazis hold on to power?  Why did the German people not protest?  What were the Nazi Party's domestic and foreign goals, and how did they use their power to achieve those goals?  Lastly, what did the German people think of what was happening in their country?  Through a combination of lectures, discussions, and weekly readings of key secondary and primary sources (translated) students will examine the main social, cultural, political, ideological, and economic facets of Germany under Weimar and National Socialism.  The course will conclude with a discussion of the legacy of these two periods in Germany and Europe.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37917, "course_id": 19674, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Please visit the bookstore for materials.

In what ways does the fringe both reflect and impact more mainstream political movements? This course explores the history of political extremism in the twentieth century United States, right and left. Beginning with labor mobilizations in the early twentieth century, we will explore the relationship between social movements and the state. We will discuss the long history of communism that gave birth to the civil rights era, and the impact of World War II (and the human rights discourse it generated) on left and right movements. We will cover the anti-war, women's rights, and civil rights movements of the sixties and seventies, and then focus on the years between the Vietnam War and the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle. What moved the far right from the self-described patriotism of the Ku Klux Klan to the openly anarchist Aryan Nations, and how did that movement spawn the Oklahoma City bombing? How did the civil rights movement give way to violent groups like the Black Panthers? We will investigate the impact of major social currentssuch as the return of veterans, poverty, and rights movementsand the way these factors energized the fringe. Finally, we will discuss the affinity against the system experienced by anarchist movements on left and right following the 1999 World Trade Organization protests, and consider what this might mean for the social, political, and cultural future of the United States.\nEvaluation will center on the successful completion of six short historical research assignments, one longer project involving independent research, and participation in class discussions.", "topic": "Political Extremism in the 20th Century U.S.", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37792, "course_id": 6359, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Cockburn, Alexander, and Jeffrey St. Clair, and Allan Sekula, Five Days That Shook the World: The Battle for Seattle and Beyond (New York: Verso, 2000).  185984779X\n\nGage, Beverly, The Day Wall Street Exploded: A Story of America in its First Age of Terror (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009). 0199759286\n\nKelly, Robin D.G., Hammer and Hoe: Alabama Communists During the Great Depression (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1990). 0807842885\n\nLepore, Jill, The Whites of Their Eyes: The Tea Party's Revolution and the Battle Over American History (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010). 0691150273\n\nAdditional materials will be posted to Blackboard and/or circulated in class."}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "desc": "This class will teach students how to think like historians, critically read historical and current-day materials, conduct independent research with primary materials, and write a well-crafted historical essay."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "This class is open to students of all backgrounds who feel prepared to undertake historical research and writing."}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Research Seminar", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Johnna Leigh Sturgeon", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "HISTORY", "catalog_num": "395-0", "section": "33", "room": "Harris Hall L05", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "12:30:00", "end_time": "13:50:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 0, "overview": "HISTORY OF THE BOOK - This course will explore how changes in the technologies of written communication in Western culture have transformed our ways of thinking and learning from the Classical era to the present.

The war in Iraq was designed by Paul Wolfowitz to \"bring democracy\" to a part of the world where it was virtually non-existent.

Are they misguided and therefore bad foundations for foreign policy decisions? Are they proxies for continued American domination?

A substantial premise of this course, which will survey a wide range of materials, with special emphasis on visual culture and literature produced between 1400 and 1600, is that Renaissance artists and scholars not only engaged the ethical value of depth, but also established a positive attitude toward the surface of the surrounding world. The immediately visible world, its objects, and their contingencies were appreciatedand not merely as vehicles of transcendence. Different topics of Italian Renaissance culture will be discussed every week, reading authors such as Alberti, Valla, Machiavelli, Michelangelo, and Caravaggio. We will consider, for example, Renaissance linear perspective as a means to represent depth but also a device that calls an unprecedented attention to the two-dimensional nature of painting, and the birth of philology not only as a rediscovery of the past, but a new way to look at documents, focusing on their material and formal aspects.

We will achieve that purpose through an in-depth study of the areas of law and ethics that are the most critical to good marketing and business judgment.\n\nDuring the quarter we will delve into:\n\n1. The First Amendment and its protection of commercial speech, the legal term for marketing communications. Marketing professionals need to know what is and isn't protectedand why.\n\n2. Our legal system and get an understanding of\na. Laws that legislate marketers and the marketing process.\nb. Administrative organizations that regulate marketers and the marketing process.\nc. Case law (court decisions) that interprets legislation and regulation, or simply makes law where none exists (based on the constitution).\nThere is an enormous amount of legislation, regulation and case law that affects the practice and profession of marketing on a daily basis. Good marketing and business decisions require a knowledge and understanding of the legal landscape.\n\n3. Contract law. The world of marketing is laden with contracts. Good contracts protect the marketer, the company, and most importantly, the brand. Good business judgment requires an understanding of the basics of contract law.\n\n4. Intellectual Property, particularly copyright and trademark law. The marketing professional needs to know and understand what can and should be protected when it comes to the brand's assets, and how to protect those assets. Conversely, marketing professionals need to understand when and how they might infringe upon the protected assets of other brands.\nThe internet and technology have created a \"wild west\" atmosphere when it comes to intellectual property and the protection of brand assets. The law continues to evolve.\n\n5. Privacy. Privacy, too, lives in the technologically ever-changing wild west. There are laws that protect our privacy - sometimes but not always. There are other laws that protect the privacy of famous people but not the rest of us. Marketers need to know when they are in danger of violating the rights of the famous and not-so-famous alike. More importantly, technology has given marketers the ability to collect nearly unlimited information about all of us. The law is getting more and more restrictive as to how that information can be used. Good marketing and business decisions require a good understanding of this body of law. Without it, it's easier than you might think to get yourself and your employer into deep trouble.\n\n6. Ethics. It's very hard to draw a line between law and ethics. There is significant overlap. It's been said that the law is the minimum standard when it comes to ethics. Good marketing judgment and good marketing decisions require an appropriately developed appreciation of ethical marketing behavior. Specifically, we will explore the ethical dimensions of:\n\na. Communications practices\nb. Behavioral targeting\nc. Marketing to children \nd. Product marketing\n\nDecisions that cross legal or ethical lines are always bad business decisions, even if made out of ignorance or with the best of intentions. A knowledge and understanding of the areas outlined above will greatly enhance your business and marketing judgment. The ability to apply that good judgment will always result in better decisions and more effective and successful marketing efforts.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory\n\nNo P/N option for this section\n\nPermission of School\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37531, "course_id": 922, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "IMC Strategic Process", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "JOUR", "instructor": {"name": "Edward Carl Malthouse", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "IMC", "catalog_num": "460-0", "section": "20", "room": "Loop 211: 210 S.

With consumers in control of the marketplace and marketing database systems moving web and traditional marketing towards 1-to-1 communications, a marketing manager needs to understand how these systems - and their analytical targeting and tracking components - can be used to identify and target the most valuable and most \"growable\" market segments.\n\nThis class is going to focus on how marketing managers can use analytics to define, target and build stronger relationships with their customers and prospects. In the class, we will focus on building the following skills:\n\n1. Understanding the business situations which benefit from analytic solutions and determining which methodology will be a `best fit' for the situation\n\n2. Managing the critical phases leading up to the analytics project\n\n3. Understanding the deliverables from all types of analytics projects\n\n4. Testing the final deliverables for accuracy and implementing them into your marketing programs\n\nIn addition to database analytics, the course will also cover key analytical methodologies and techniques used on the web. We will develop skills in monitoring a website, developing testing methodologies to improve the performance of a page, and will examine the integration of databases and websites to drive personal URLs and other forms of personalized communications.\n\nWhile our class will cover some theory, the bulk of the class will focus on real-world applications of these analytical techniques. Where possible, class members will be encouraged to use their own businesses as a platform from which to learn how analytical and measurement systems are being utilized [or not utilized] in the `real world' today. At the end of the course, our objective will be for every class participant to be able to assess their company's web and database systems to identify areas of improvement and actively develop a plan to improve these opportunity areas.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 36342, "course_id": 18188, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Customer Loyalty", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "JOUR", "instructor": {"name": "Paul Wang", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "IMC", "catalog_num": "485-0", "section": "20", "room": "Loop 202: 210 S.

Nothing stands still. Everything is in constant motion. The journey of breakthrough innovation can expose us to unthinkable dangers, but also to unimaginable outcomes. Necessity breeds innovation. Organizations that attempt to survive and excel in an ever-changing marketplace don't just need to encourage and stimulate innovation. They also have to make it successful financially. The spirit of innovation, carefully fostered and focused, can become one of the key success factors for establishing sustainable competitive advantage and achieving persistent organic growth. This is easy to say, but hard to do. It takes some courage (or humility) to learn, unlearn and relearn. It requires an intelligent, analytically minded change agent who can be a genuine visionary as well as a practical doer. \n\nThe main focus of the course is to examine the uncertain and dynamic nature of innovation. Demonstrating value innovation is hard to do. Recognizing value innovation is even harder to accomplish. How can we improve the way we introduce and nurture customer value innovation? It goes without saying that change (or transformation) of any kind is always a risk. How can we deal with ambiguity and uncertainty? How much of a risk should we take?

What was the idea of modernization about and did it succeed? How did it happen that China became an industrial giant and what are its prospects for the future?

At the end of the full-year 101 sequence, students will be able to ask and answer simple questions in Italian, to write a grammatically correct sentence, and to follow the drift of a simple conversation. Students will gain knowledge of fundamental aspects of Italian culture, history, & geography through the study of language.

B2B reporters, editors and publishers become or collaborate with experts and specialists, and often report targeted information well before the general media does. While B2B operations can be lean, they reward cross-media expertise at competitive salaries and offer smaller pyramids to the top of the masthead.\n \nWe'll enter this world by exploring how print, digital, video and social media contribute to a \"brand circle\" within a publishing niche. Lectures and exercises will demonstrate how and when these components serve and lead focused audiences as they make business or product decisions for their companies, practices, organizations.

Studies.\n        \n        In this course, we will study the legal regulation of gender and sexuality.  We will begin with the legal and political history of women's rights and lesbian and gay rights.  We will then consider contemporary legal regulation of gender and sexuality in several arenas, including criminal regulation of sex; pornography, sex toys, and prostitution; families; the military; hate crimes; and health care and HIV/AIDS.  We will conclude with developing issues in LGBT law: schools, immigration, and transgender rights.  While we will focus on contemporary U.S. law, we will also consider comparisons from other periods of U.S. history and from other countries.\n\n       Questions to be addressed include how does the law regulate gender and sexuality, and what justifications are offered for those regulations?  How should the law regulate gender and sexuality?  Are there justifications for sex segregation of restrooms?  Should HIV-positive individuals be required to disclose their status before sex?  What assumptions does the law make about gender and sexuality, and the relationship between them?  How do regulations on men, women, straights, and gays in the military depend on certain assumptions?  How does coverage (or the lack thereof) of pregnancy and abortion by health insurance reflect certain assumptions about gender and sexuality?  What is the relationship between culture and legal regulation of gender and sexuality?  How do cultural norms underlie our legal approaches to pornography?  How does legal regulation of marriage reinforce certain cultural norms?  How can the law be a tool for social change?  How have  lawyers mobilized sex discrimination law to create protections for transgender persons?  Can pro-gay court rulings have undesired side effects for women's rights?\n\n         Readings include court opinions and other sources of law, newspaper and other media sources, and scholarly analysis from law, sociology of law and sexualities, critical race theory, gender studies, and queer studies.  Our approach to the law will be useful beyond just the context of law, gender, and sexuality.  We will learn to think about the law as a cultural object.  That is, instead of examining the law as a source of rules, we will examine the law as a site of cultural meaning-making.  We will ask how and when culture influences and constrains the law, and vice-versa, how and when the law influences and constrains culture.  We will consider how the law and legal structures help frame our everyday understandings of gender and sexuality.", "topic": "Law, Gender, and Sexuality", "attributes": "SoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 32122, "course_id": 15655, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Professional Linkage Seminar", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Nicole B Bazer", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "LEGAL_ST", "catalog_num": "394-0", "section": "20", "room": "2122 Sheridan Rd Classroom 232", "meeting_days": "Th", "start_time": "18:00:00", "end_time": "21:00:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 0, "overview": null, "topic": "The Robert's Supreme Court", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37573, "course_id": 16098, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Freshman Seminar", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Robert A Gundlach", "bio": null, "address": "Crowe Hall 2-179", "phone": "8474914968", "office_hours": "By appointment"}, "subject": "LING", "catalog_num": "101-6", "section": "20", "room": "University Library 3670", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "12:20:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 15, "overview": "In this seminar we will explore the complexity and power of the human voice as we encounter it in speech and writing.

Learning is mediated by the context in which it occurs. This course pays special attention to organizations as a context and analyzes this context through different lenses of organizational theory. Throughout the course students will learn multiple frameworks for observing and analyzing organizations. Using these frameworks, the course will provide students with social science tools needed to analyze organizational problems and influence the actions of individuals, groups and organizations.

Its purpose is to introduce students to some core constructs and some theorizing about the social dimensions of human learning and cognition - children and adults - both in formal and informal learning settings.  It provides a selective overview of some of the key debates in the field enabling students to identify particular areas for more focused study.  \n\nThe course is divided into two sections.  The first section surveys the landscape and introduces students to some core theorizing on the social dimensions of cognition and learning.  We will focus on four broad and sometimes overlapping attempts to theorize the social - situated cognition, socio-cultural activity theory, distributed cognition, and a sociological perspective.  Our primary goal here is not to find the one best theory of the social but rather to examine the particulars of different theories, compare and contrast their theorizing, analyze how they define (or fail to do so) key constructs, and consider the implications of these theories for empirical research on human cognition and learning.  The second section of the course engages students with selected empirical work on children and adult learning in formal and informal settings.  Our goal here is to interrogate these studies in light of the theoretical work we considered in the first part of the course.  Specifically, we want to begin to understand how researchers operationalize constructs and theories about the social dimensions of human cognition and learning (or fail to do so) in order that we can learn how we can approach empirical studies of the social dimensions of human cognition and learning.\n\nA central goal of this course is to learn how to ask research questions about the role of social contexts in learning and cognition, how to conceptualize and frame such research investigations, how to operationalize key constructs for research purposes and how to interrogate the extant literature in an informed manner.

The seminar course is required for all ME PhD students. \n\nWhat it's about \n\nThis course meets once per week, and each session is run by different faculty members in an innovative forum to address the syllabus topics. The purpose is to expose students to a variety of skills necessary to advance as a researcher during and after their PhD studies. The topics of teaching and technical writing and presentation are incredibly important in a student's future success and yet are seldom taught in a systematic fashion in standard PhD curricula. This course addresses this need by tackling these topics drawing on the expertise of our own faculty. The course is about 1/2 seminar and 1/2 interactive discussion. Some sessions are run as panel discussions and in several areas students will actively participate and be provided feedback on their performance by the faculty. Areas for student activity include preparation and presentation of a short mini-lecture on a research topic, and writing a proposal for a research or teaching lab need. \n\nContact: Malcolm MacIver\nProfessor: e-mail: maciver@northwestern.edu", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 34278, "course_id": 5262, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "No consent required."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "No grade is given in this zero credit seminar class.

How has the music of this internal ethnic \"other\" been appropriated, mimicked, and altered over time? What is the relationship between the folkloric musics of the Roma and their evocation in other repertoires? This class will attempt to answer such questions by focusing on a variety of repertoires performed or inspired by the Roma people, especially Roma music from Spain, but also from Hungary, the Balkans, and its roots in India; Andalucian flamenco; 19th-century opera (Bizet's Carmen, Verdi's La traviata); instrumental works by Haydn, Liszt, Brahms, and J. Strauss; Django Reinhardt; and more recent \"world\" music phenomena such as the Gipsy Kings. The relationship of Roma identity to the writings of Liszt and Bartk will also be considered.

The debates, and the topic of opera more generally, attracted some of the era's leading philosophes and other intellectual figures, too, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau (who also tried his hand at opera composition) and Denis Diderot.  Further, scholars have shown that the querelles were never just about music: opera was entwined here with key political and philosophical debates of the age.   In this course we will study several operas that were heard in Paris in the 18th century and played a role in these querelles, including Rameau's Castor et Pollux, Rousseau's Le devin du village, and the competing versions by Gluck and Piccinni of Iphignie en Tauride, among other works.

Over the ensuing 25 years, Britten would create a series of engaging operatic works, owing on one hand much to 19th-century dramatic conventions while on the other exploring complex contemporary social issues through aspects of musical modernism. His elusive characters embody issues of sexual otherness, taking Romantic notions of the wanderer or the outcast to new levels of meaning. The dichotomy between the \"closet\" and open homosexuality, both in Britten's personal life and in his operatic narratives, parallels and informs the contemporaneous struggle for legalization of homosexuality in the UK, which occurred in 1967.\n\n \n\nThis graduate seminar will focus on four of Britten's operas, Peter Grimes, Billy Budd, The Turn of the Screw, and Death in Venice. We will examine the literary sources, interrogate Britten's musical construction of character, view the operas through the lens of queer and sexuality studies, and assess the historical importance of the operatic revival, especially in the context of other composers such as Tippett. Students will produce a critical research paper on a topic of their choice by the end of the quarter.", "topic": "Benjamin Britten", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37647, "course_id": 19467, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "Open to advanced undergraduate students and graduate students in the School of Music; others by permission"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Research Center Seminar", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "MUSIC", "instructor": {"name": "Inna I Naroditskaya", "bio": null, "address": "in-narod@northwestern.edu", "phone": "847/467-2034", "office_hours": "TBD"}, "subject": "MUSICOL", "catalog_num": "490-0", "section": "20", "room": "Music Administration Bldg 37", "meeting_days": "Th", "start_time": "16:00:00", "end_time": "17:00:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 30, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37645, "course_id": 19245, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Introduction to Music Technology", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "MUSIC", "instructor": {"name": "Brett Masteller", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "MUS_TECH", "catalog_num": "259-0", "section": "20", "room": "University Lib B182 - Comp Cla", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "09:30:00", "end_time": "10:50:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 18, "overview": "Survey of music software and hardware for the professional musician.

The course will engage the following ongoing questions:\n\nHow can we locate quotidian performances that disrupt torture, apartheid, genocide and famine?\nHow do these performances create possibilities for alternative forms of governance?\nHow does performance help us identify human rights as it is honored and, in contrast, as it is violated within specific social contexts?\nHow can we, as both art makers and theorists, promote human rights through art?\nWhat is a radical performance?\nIs radical performance necessary to draw attention to human rights abuses and to initate change?\nHow do we recognize human rights as a philosophy and way of life in varying contexts and struggles through performance?\nHow do we articulate the relationship between performance, human rights, hegemony and what is often referred to as \"domination and the arts of resistance\"?", "topic": null, "attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37404, "course_id": 18644, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "RUINED by Lynn Nottage\nMY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE, edited by Alan Rickman and Katherine Viner\nCourse Reader"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Seminar: Problems in Performance Studies", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Sandra L Richards", "bio": null, "address": "1860 Campus Dr. Crowe 5-101", "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "PERF_ST", "catalog_num": "515-0", "section": "20", "room": "Kresge Centennial Hall 2-425", "meeting_days": "Th", "start_time": "14:00:00", "end_time": "16:50:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 7, "overview": "This team-taught course stages a series of dialogues between US black feminist theory and black queer theory through the discussion of such topics as: the legacy of slavery; activism; work, family and self-esteem; body politics, i.e, sexuality, reproduction, violence, HIV/AIDs, popular culture representations; appropriations and alliances.\n\nAdmission to the course is by permission of instructors only.

Is it reasonable to believe in a providential divine being, in spite of so much evil?  Do we have an immortal soul, and is its continuation what makes each of us a single person persisting through time? Might that soul be eternal? Why should we strive to be good people and to fulfill our obligations to others? Where do our values come from, and how can they be defended? If we are shaped by our genes and our environment, is it misguided for us to hold each other responsible, and to praise and blame each other? How can we be free to shape our own lives?

It introduces the feminist political philosophy classics as responses to those traditions (we read excerpts from figures such as Mary Wollstonecraft, John Stuart Mill, Harriet Taylor, Friedrich Engels, Simone de Beauvoir, Carole Pateman). One focus of the course considers the way in which traditional claims to rights, freedom and political futures were also based on the exclusion of a number of groups. How have the leading traditions subsequently been reworked to include previously excluded groups? Have interesting paradoxes and inconsistencies arisen in rights discourse as a result? From the perspective of this question, we consider how contemporary political theorists have taken up such issues as justice and the family, pornography, prostitution, surrogacy contracts, and the 'politics of the veil' in the public sphere. We conclude with some contemporary debates and figures in feminist political philosophy, drawing from figures such as Susan Moller Okin, Pateman, Joan Scott and Judith Butler.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Ethics & Values Distro Area\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 36858, "course_id": 19207, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "READING List with ISBNs: \nNo textbook.\nInstead a collection of readings to be purchased from Quartet Copies. \nExcerpts drawn from the following list of works (not all readings considered in all years): \nCarole Pateman, The Sexual Contract \nKimberle Crenshaw. \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics.\" The University of Chicago Legal Forum, Volume 1989: Feminism in the Law: Theory, Practice and Criticism, pp139-168. \nJ.-J.

These are issues of very great practical, as well as philosophical, importance.  \nThis course aims to introduce students to those authors and positions on, and issues concerning, personal identity which are currently the most prominent and influential.  We shall compare and contrast psychological and bodily criteria of personal identity (Lewis, Johnston).  We shall examine Parfit's view that what matters most to us is not identity but survival.  We shall examine Schechtman's view that what matters most for moral purposes is descriptive identity and not quantitative identity.\nViews about identity are reflected in disputes about the beginning and end of human life.  We shall ask what engaging in these disputes can teach us about identity.  In particular, we shall enquire what sense anti-essentialists can make of these issuesi.e., what sense can you make of these issues if you think there is no uniquely correct answer to the question of what we essentially are.\n(See tentative schedule for more detail.)", "topic": "Personal Identity, Birth", "attributes": "Graduate Students Only\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37044, "course_id": 2642, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "NOTE: Section 20 is dedicated to undergraduates only.

These are issues of very great practical, as well as philosophical, importance.  \nThis course aims to introduce students to those authors and positions on, and issues concerning, personal identity which are currently the most prominent and influential.  We shall compare and contrast psychological and bodily criteria of personal identity (Lewis, Johnston).  We shall examine Parfit's view that what matters most to us is not identity but survival.  We shall examine Schechtman's view that what matters most for moral purposes is descriptive identity and not quantitative identity.\nViews about identity are reflected in disputes about the beginning and end of human life.  We shall ask what engaging in these disputes can teach us about identity.  In particular, we shall enquire what sense anti-essentialists can make of these issuesi.e., what sense can you make of these issues if you think there is no uniquely correct answer to the question of what we essentially are.\n(See tentative schedule for more detail.)", "topic": "Personal Identity, Birth", "attributes": "SoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 33337, "course_id": 2642, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "NOTE: Section 20 is dedicated to undergraduates only.

The primary theoretical orientation or framework that will be introduced and developed will be \"interest group theory,\" a loose and somewhat inconsistent set of concepts and ideas, rather than a coherent package. But \"interest group theory,\" with its many limitations, may be a most useful framework for understanding the reality of American policy concerning natural resources and the human environment. This course focuses upon the environmental policy issues and conflicts in the United States but this will be juxtaposed with ecological issues of the globe. The readings, as well as class sessions, should allow us to reflect this larger context for American policy. The primary focus of attention will be upon natural resources and environmental policy as made and implemented by administrative agencies, rather than by legislative bodies. But no easy separation can be made among branches of government when examining environmental issues. It is useful to think of the environmental policy system in the United States as consisting of two rather distinct sub-systems. One is concerned with contests over natural resources - land, forests, waters, etc. Issues within this sub-system typically concern such things as protecting biological diversity, endangered species, forests and so on. This can be called the Interior or natural resources sub-system. The system more or less \"peaks\" in the Department of the Interior. The other policy sub-system, peaking in the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), largely concerns  air and water pollution and other manifestations of urban-industrial life. While the class will be concerned with the full range of environmental policy issues and processes, the primary focus will be on the Interior or natural resources sub-system.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Social & Behavioral Sciences Distro Area\n\nSoComm Individual/Social Behavior Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 36984, "course_id": 2812, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "TBA"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "Attendance in class and discussion sections,\nmidterm and final exam, and  paper, based upon primary source material"}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "lectures and discussions"}, {"name": "Learning Objectives", "desc": "Smarter and more effective students"}], "coursecomponent_set": [{"component": "DIS", "meeting_days": "Fr", "start_time": "09:00:00", "end_time": "09:50:00", "section": "62", "room": "Parkes Hall 214"}, {"component": "DIS", "meeting_days": "We", "start_time": "13:00:00", "end_time": "13:50:00", "section": "61", "room": "University Hall 312"}, {"component": "DIS", "meeting_days": "We", "start_time": "12:00:00", "end_time": "12:50:00", "section": "60", "room": "University Hall 412"}]}, {"title": "Constitutional Law I", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Martin Jay Sweet", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "POLI_SCI", "catalog_num": "332-0", "section": "20", "room": "Fisk Hall 217", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "12:20:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 85, "overview": "This is an upper-level undergraduate course examining the function and functioning of the Constitution, largely through historically great Supreme Court cases.

Since China's government embraced market economics and opened to the outside world in 1978 the country has become a manufacturing powerhouse and made strides toward modernizing its agriculture. A dramatic migration of its population from the countryside to its cities is underway.  Building construction is proceeding at a scale never matched anywhere.  Per capita GDP has increased by an order of magnitude.  China's rapid economic growth --- some years exceeding ten percent --- has succeeded in raising hundreds of millions of its 1.3 billion people out of poverty. This miracle of economic growth, however, has come at significant cost to the natural environment and to public health.  Unprecedented air pollution, water pollution, deforestation, desertification, toxic waste contamination, and loss of arable land have resulted.  The  air in many of China's cities is nearly unbreathable, and a shockingly high percentage of China's fresh water sources cannot be drunk from, fished in, or even used for industrial purposes.  China's environmental problems, moreover, escape its borders.  Air pollution in Korea, Japan, and the Western United States is traceable to China, and it now generates the most greenhouse gases of any nation, a major challenge to international efforts to stem global warming. These issues are not altogether new.  The culture has never embraced a strong  environmental ethic, and its history is punctuated by centuries-long assaults on the country's forests, wetlands, rivers, mineral deposits and other natural features.  Up until very recently the priority at all levels of government has remained \"development before environment.\"  Modest governmental efforts in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s to meet the accelerating environmental damage linked to rapid economic growth proved inadequate and the rate of environmental encroachments actually increased.  The country's dependence on the Chinese Communist Party for leadership and policy formulation, its relatively undeveloped NGO community, and the absence of a Chinese tradition of public participation, are some of the factors that complicate its environmental problems.  Officialdom and courts have lacked the authority or the political will, or both, to achieve good results.  But there are now indications of growing environmental concerns among Party leaders, and the impact of pollution on public health is no longer being ignored.", "topic": "Chinese Economic Development & Environ Policy", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 37815, "course_id": 6550, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Economy, Elizabeth C, \"The River Runs Black: The Environmental Challenge to China's Future,\" Second Edition, Cornell University Press, 2010, ISBN 978-0-8014-7613-6 (Paperback).  352 pp plus index."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "Students will be expected to attend all classes and participate actively in discussion.

The seminar is organized into three main parts and strikes an equal balance between primary sources and secondary literature. After an introduction to varieties of conceptualizing cosmopolitan citizenship, the first part traces the origins of cosmopolitan ideas in the ancient Greeks and Romans (Diogenes, Cicero, Marcus Aurelius). The second part, focusing on the early modern period, examines cosmopolitanism in jurisprudential thought (Grotius, Pufendorf, Vattel); followed by Enlightenment debates on patriotism and cosmopolitan sentiments (Voltaire,  Abbe de Saint-Pierre, Rousseau); and to be concluded by projects for perpetual peace (Kant). The third part, on modern conceptions of cosmopolitanism, examines Nationalism and Patriotism (Fichte, Nussbaum, Appiah, Hobsbawm); Cosmopolitanism and Human Rights (Habermas, Archibugi, Held, Tully); and Cosmopolitanism and International Justice (Dunn, Miller, Pogge).

Do psychologists still show people inkblots? Why does my future employer want me to take a personality test? This course will address these and many other questions related to the current science of psychological tests and measures. The assessments we'll focus on will be primarily from the fields of clinical and personality psychology. We will also cover some tests relevant to social psychology and industrial-organizational psychology. Course topics include the theory behind psychological testing and assessment; the historical context for psychological testing and related legal and ethical considerations; the basics of test construction and evaluation, including reliability, validity, and standardization; and common measures of personality, psychopathology, and ability, and their psychometric properties. During the course, you will work to develop your own measure of a psychological construct and to evaluate the psychometric soundness of test scores resulting from this measure. After successful completion of this course, you should be able to demonstrate proficiency with regard to the terminology and concepts involved in psychological testing, conduct relevant statistical analyses including factor analysis, demonstrate an understanding of the purposes and applications of commonly used psychological tests, and critically evaluate the use and misuse of psychological testing, both historically and presently.

The focus of this course is on completion of an empirical health services research paper and oral presentation, as described below.  \n\nBecause of the intensive student-instructor interaction required to complete projects within the allotted time, course enrollment will be limited to six students.  Students wishing to enroll will need to contact the MPH office and the instructor for approval to enroll and an enrollment number.  In the event that more than six students seek to enroll, preference will be given to more senior students with the best developed ideas for potential projects that can be successfully completed within the ten week quarter.  Interested students must call or email the instructor as soon as possible and prior to the first week of the quarter to discuss acceptability of potential class project ideas. \n\nRequired Research Projects \n\nThe class has been designed to facilitate students in the completion of a written research project, which will also be orally presented to the class in at least a 20 minute presentation.  Completion of project assignments within the dates described below is critical for acceptable performance in this class.  No required readings are assigned, but each student will be expected to incorporate a systematic literature review of all key materials on their topic and provide a comprehensive bibliography (if at all possible in endnote format) as part of their projects.  There is no final exam.\n\nIn these projects, students will demonstrate their ability to clearly frame problem statements, undertake evidence-based literature reviews, describe and justify choice of research design and statistical methods, and demonstrate the capability to perform basic data processing and data table and figure preparation procedures.  Projects should address important issues in health care policy, financing, patient outcomes, technology assessment, cost effectiveness, quality of care, patient safety, or social epidemiology research.  Although we encourage individual assignments, students are also encouraged to work in pairs or groups with course instructor permission.  For multiple student projects there will be a corresponding increase in the expectation of effort relative to individual assignments.  I strongly encourage students to work on research projects related to their MPH culminating experience and/or fellowships.  \n\nStudents will formally prepare an approximate 20 minute presentation for the entire class during the scheduled project presentation session(s) at the end of the quarter.  Students will need to make regular (usually weekly) in-person appointments to discuss progress on their projects with the course instructor and/or other designated faculty mentors, as well as regularly communicating progress and problems by phone or email.  Students may be required to provide individualized SPSS, STATA or other statistical software programs or output tables used for descriptive and multivariate statistics or other analytic needs at specified intervals.  Computer workstations are available in the medical school library or by agreement with selected faculty.  \n\nCourse Research Project Minimum Requirements\n\nAn (at least) 8 page double-spaced, referenced paper with additional table or figure pages is required.  This will generally involve analysis of an existing (secondary) database from a health services research perspective, analyzing variations in structure, process or outcomes of medical care, incidence or prevalence of designated conditions in a health survey, or a health economic, policy or advocacy analysis.  In general, these will most often be retrospective, hypothesis-generating studies from a public health perspective.  An analytic exercise, such as a decision analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, or meta-analysis is also an acceptable alternative if it addresses relevant health services research issues.

The focus of qualitative research is usually on the underlying meanings of human behaviors, beliefs, attitudes, etc., from the research participant's own view, and in his/her own words, sometimes referred to as an \"emic\" perspective.  Data collection activities can include first-person accounts, life history narratives, life history calendars, visual or documentary records, semi-structured and open-ended interviews, informal and formal observations, as well as other biographical and autobiographical materials. Through triangulation of methods, the researcher attempts to make sense of and interpret phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them. Essentially, qualitative research deals with words, spoken and written.\n\nThis course will focus on qualitative research methods and will include investigation of issues related to research design, sampling, data management, analysis and report writing.  Methods covered will include unstructured, semi-structured, and structured interviewing, writing and using field notes, cognitive interviewing for survey construction, group interview methodologies, participant observation, cognitive tasks such as decision modeling, domain analysis and the use of mapping techniques in qualitative research.  Questions of reliability and validity in qualitative research will be addressed. Data analytic procedures will include thematic analyses and code development, consensus and network analyses, and an overview of qualitative data management programs. We will also explore the relationships between qualitative and quantitative research, and the use of multiple methods in the research setting.

Through careful examination of a variety of literature produced by these traditions, we will consider the many ways in which Buddhists have understood human suffering, life after death, karma, the nature of the world and human's place within it, and the path to enlightenment.\n\n<p>Our emphasis will be on attempting to understand the moral values,  philosophical insights, ritual practices, and social concerns that have shaped Buddhism over centuries of dynamic change in diverse cultural contexts. We will examine not only the history of Buddhism and its three-fold division into Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana/Tantrayana, but also facets of the contemporary practice of Buddhism in the United States and the role of socially engaged Buddhism. In addition to some textbook readings, reading assignments will privilege primary source readings in order to introduce students directly to the narrative, doctrinal, liturgical, and biographical texts that inform our knowledge of what it has meant to live a Buddhist life over time and across cultures.\n\n<p>As an academic course in the Department of Religious Studies, this course draws on scholarly approaches to the study of religion to examine the history of Buddhist thought and practice.

What is \"reality\" and what is a \"representation\"? Although various early forms of the genre, such as actuality footage or propaganda films, have existed since the very beginning of cinema, the idea of \"documentary\" itself as a category for identifying a particular type of movie was a relatively late addition to film studies. In the first half of the 20th Century, travelogues, newsreels, government films, city symphonies, instructional/educational films, even staged recreations of historical events, and so forth, all relied on, and perpetuated, the assumption of a film's factual relationship to the world around it, but the notion of the documentary film as a distinct mode of movie production, aesthetics and reception came later. As audiences and filmmakers began to recognize this fundamentally different type of cinematic presentation, a new set of more specific questions arose around such issues as: the factualism and bias of the text, staging and scripting, ethical and unethical filmmaking behavior, animated or recreated footage, observer-participant roles, the indexicality and artificiality of images and sounds, expository and poetic modes of narration, political and social activism, the value of found or compilation footage, potential commercial implications, and so forth. To this day, the question of how exactly to define a documentary film, and of what educational, social and cultural value the documentary possesses, still persists. This course is intended as a critical introduction, one which will explore the histories, definitions, and larger debates surrounding the genre. We will consider the work of canonical filmmakers and writers in the field, which may include: John Grierson, Robert Flaherty, Pare Lorentz, Joris Ivens, Dziga Vertov, Leni Riefenstahl, Bruce Brown, D.A. Pennebaker, Robert Drew, Werner Herzog, Michael Moore, and Errol Morris. We will also touch on more recent films, such as Andrew Jarecki's Capturing the Friedmans, Spike Lee's When the Levees Broke or Banksy's Exit Through the Gift Shop, as well as topical developments such as the rise of mockumentaries and \"Reality TV.\"", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 35327, "course_id": 4350, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Bill Nichols, Introduction to Documentary 2nd ed.

They are not genres, strictly speaking, but assemble films from a number of genres in the name (literally) of female viewers who are in turn presumed to find particular pleasures in the stories they tell.  The Woman's Picture was the common designation for these films during the classic studio era; Chick Flick is a more recent nomenclature, centrally associated with films from the post-classical era, especially the past few decades (though retrospectively applied to older movies).  \nThis class looks at films and criticism/analysis of the films that belong to these two categories.  This  includes engagement with scholarly literature on these films, largely developed in the context of feminist film criticism and history.  We also consider some of the historical contexts and intertexts for these filmse.g. modes of literature and television that are also strongly associated with women readers/viewers (daytime soap opera; chick lit; etc.); and the various ways in which the films are valued/devalued especially in consideration of gender issues.", "topic": "Woman's Pictures/Chick Flicks", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 35329, "course_id": 4357, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Required Readings will be in a course pack (approx. $30.00)."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "Students will be graded on participation and 3 writing assignments (papers and take-home essays)."}, {"name": "Teaching Method", "desc": "The class will include lecture, discussion, and screenings of films."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "This class is intended for undergraduates.

Yet at its core there remains still largely unanswered, but fascinating, questions about the nature of an image which has shifted, through digital video cameras and the digital intermediate, from an direct relationship to the object being captured to a binary series of ones and zeroes. In The Virtual Life of Film, D.N. Rodowick recently observed that a digital camera is not really a camera, but rather \"logically, it is a computer with a lens as an input device.\" While digital filmmaking offers the chance for a greater degree of perceptual and aesthetic perfection, the process itself can increasingly remove the image from that which it often seeks to faithfully reproduce. At the same time, these issues of realism and indexicality are not new to digital filmmaking; they stretch as far back as cinema itself. In 1946, French theorist Andre Bazin in \"The Myth of Total Cinema\" both reflected on and further anticipated how every advance in film technology was and would be motivated by the desire to attain a greater degree of perceptual \"realism.\" While the exigencies of various digital technologies have complicated the specifics of that pursuit, many of the same fundamental questions about representation remain decades later. As such, this course will approach the subject of digital cinema from a historical and cultural perspective that situates these exciting developments within a larger discussion of changes in film technology through the years. The emphasis will be on seeing the current moment as a continuation, and even affirmation, of \"cinema\" rather than its demise. Indeed, some of the most interesting discussions on the digital image in the last few yearssuch as Rodowick and Nicholas Rombeshave focused on how various ontological and technological issues in digital film today are rooted in a mutually reinforcing relationship with older analog and photo-chemical media. How does, in a sense, the ghost of film haunt digital cinema? We will also explore other theoretical topics on the ontological nature of the digital image, which may include: posthumanism, cinematic affect, images of the body, the aesthetics of visual effects, notions of cinematic time, rotoscoping, spectatorship and audience reception, relationships with other new media, film nostalgia, implications for labor practices and commodity culture, post-cinema, representations of history, and so forth. The topics discussed each week will be rooted in issues raised by the screenings and assigned readings from such thinkers such as Bazin, Rodowick and Rombes. Other writers may include the following: Roland Barthes, Lev Manovich, Bob Rehak, Kristen Whissel, Tom Gunning, Julie Turnock, Chuck Tryon, Vivian Sobchack, Sean Cubitt, Laura Mulvey, Stephen Prince,

Students will also do original research/interviews on the conditions of male friendship in our time as the basis for their final projects.\n\nStudents will then produce a final project in the bromance genre: a short film based on an original script concept (we'll be soliciting script collaborations with RTF screenwriting students), or will write (two drafts) of a short screenplay.", "topic": "Making the Bromance", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 35131, "course_id": 4375, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "Students must have previously completed RTVF 190-Media Construction\nStudents must be at least in their sophomore year\nStudents may only take one upper-level production course per quarter"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Topics in F/V/A Production", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Debra K Tolchinsky", "bio": null, "address": "1920 Campus Dr. Room 211", "phone": "847/467-1758", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "RTVF", "catalog_num": "379-0", "section": "24", "room": "Helmerich Auditorium", "meeting_days": "Mo", "start_time": "15:00:00", "end_time": "17:50:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 15, "overview": "In this course, students will examine the conventions of horror and respond by creating their own short and frightful film or video.

Born in 1899 to one of Imperial Russia's most prominent and powerful families, the author came to symbolize for many the tragedy and complexity of Eastern Europe and the West during the Soviet period. Nabokov, with works like Lolita and Pale Fire, achieved such great fame (not to mention infamy) in the West that he became one of the world's first truly \"global\" literary celebrities, despite never having been published in his country during his lifetime. The course will explore the author's Russian literary heritage, the cultural climate in which he grew up in late Imperial Petersburg, the beginning of his career in emigre Berlin and Paris, his work in the United States and Switzerland, and finally his legacy as it extends into the 21st century. Lecture and discussion topics will include, but not be limited to, the author's often cryptic, playful relationships to film, philosophy, linguistic and literary innovation, gender, and, as far as is possible, morality and politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nReading\nFour major novels, short stories, autobiography.

We will examine such musical forms as Mexican corridos,  Andean huaynos, Colombian vallenato, Nueva Trova/Nova Trova, and Dominican bachata and merengue.  Readings may include texts by Amrico Paredes, Jos Mara Arguedas, Ana Lydia Vega, Luis Rafael Snchez, Ramn Marrero Aristy, Aurora Arias, and the texts and music of Rita Indiana Hernndez.

Taking this as its premise, this seminar proposes to investigate the ways in which Latin American literature of the last three decades has confronted the construction of the past and of memory.  The retrospective interest in \"going back\" has led to the appearance of versions and rewritings of the past which focus on \"other\" agents and facts of history, producing new versions and stories of history that question and shake up those established by official history.  These retellings also reveal the open and unstable character of memory.\n \nThe objective of this course is to analyze the diverse modes of representation of the past - historical fiction, family novels, memoirs, diaries, autobiography, testimony, documentary, movies, installations, paintings - in order to study the aesthetic, discursive and political strategies at the base of the construction of the past. It will also explore the modes of recording, commemorating, ritualizing, forgetting, rewriting memory - personal, familial, collective, national.

"Bunraku: The Art of Japanese Puppet Theatre\n\nCourse Description:\n\nWhat can puppets express that human actors cannot? How can a traditional art form grow and proliferate over time? In this class, we will consider the art of Japanese puppet theatre, or Bunraku, which rose to prominence in 17th century Japan and continues to be performed today. Bunraku puppets are large, mechanically sophisticated, lifelike figures that require three performers to operate them effectively, and we will begin our inquiry by developing a solid understanding of the dramatic conventions and artistic practices of this unique tradition. We will then turn our attention to the texts of the famous playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon, with an eye to the ways in which meaning in traditional Bunraku performance was shaped by the aesthetic, religious, political, and social assumptions held by its audiences. Our final weeks will be devoted to the ways in which Bunraku has influenced contemporary arts, from Japanese film and anime to theatre companies like Handspring Puppet Company (South Africa) or Le Thtre du Soleil (France). Our study will stem from play texts (in English), recorded performances and documentaries, and scholarly commentary. Evaluation will include small group performance projects and a final 6-8 page research paper.", "topic": "Bunraku", "attributes": "No P/N option for this section\n\n", "requirements": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Theatre Majors", "component": "LEC", "class_num": 35340, "course_id": 4576, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Theatre in Context", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Katherine Withee Sweaney", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "THEATRE", "catalog_num": "140-2", "section": "22", "room": "Parkes Hall 213", "meeting_days": "MoWe", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "12:20:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 12, "overview": "What are the ethics of staging violence?

In this course, we will trace a broad arc through theatre history's most gruesome forms of staged violence, including Roman amphitheatre spectacles, medieval saints' plays, Jacobean tragedy, Victorian melodrama, Futurism, Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty, and the In-Yer-Face theatre of the 1990s. The course will pay particular attention to the localized cultural climates that in which these forms arose.

How have Euro-American musicals represented, co-opted, and/or distorted Asian culture and performance traditions, and to what political end?  What are the challenges and opportunities inherent in reviving \"politically incorrect\" yet artistically significant musical works in our own historical moment?\n\n In this course, we will engage with these questions through the study of music-theatre works that dramatize encounters between Western and Asian peoples in East Asia and the Pacific Islands. We will begin with works from the late-19th century opera before taking up the mid-20th-century musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein and the late 20th century visions of Sondheim/Weidman/Wheeler and Boublil and Schonberg. Finally, we will look at how Asian dramatic forms have, in turn, engaged with, appropriated and transformed American musical theatre traditions. Our study of these musical works will be supplemented with readings from critical literature, as well as other films and plays that critique the legacy of the musicals under discussion.", "topic":

We will explore the theatrical representations of women, as well as their varied levels of participation in stage comedies, beginning with the origins of comic drama in ancient Greece and Rome and following through to its subsequent incarnations in the Italian Renaissance forms of Commedia erudita and Commedia dell'arte. Each week will we read and analyze comedies featuring women characters in order to ask such questions as: What makes women funny? How do various playwrights portray the female gender and which, if any, contemporary social, cultural and political norms do these theatrical portrayals reflect or refract? We will mine both plays and secondary scholarship for contextual information on women players and women spectators in order to ask: What relationship did real women have with the comic theatre of their time periods? How do these relationships change, if at all? And were women laughing too?", "topic": "Funny Girls: Women&Comedy in Wstrn Theatrical Trad", "attributes": "No P/N option for this section\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 35281, "course_id": 4665, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Special Topics in History", "term": "2011 Spring", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Keith Byron Kirk", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "THEATRE", "catalog_num": "366-0", "section": "22", "room": "University Hall 412", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "15:30:00", "end_time": "16:50:00", "start_date": "2011-03-28", "end_date": "2011-06-04", "seats": 15, "overview": "Influence and Adaptation: Cultural Narratives in American Theater\n \nWhat is \"Culture?\" With \"culture\" at its center this 300 level course introduces students of multiple disciplines to the study of theatre and its ability to adapt and combine known Greek, European and  culturally diverse American forms with existing plays, films, and other performed narratives as a way of reconstructing social boundaries, deciphering identities and, recontextualizing what we understand about ourselves and those around us. More specifically, this course will explore how varied media are often used as a beginning for new stories and new ways of witnessing performance. How have culturally informed performance practices assisted in the constant reworking of themes both old and new? What is the importance of text, narrative, and structure when discussing adaptation? How do classical and modern texts speak to today's artists and audiences? Throughout the semester, students will read plays, academic criticism and theatre history; attend theatrical performances and events; and view screenings of recorded performances. This will lead to the student's creation of their own work that will be presented at the end of the semester. The class has the following objectives: to expand student's critical vocabulary relating to the theater and performance studies; to assist students in identifying formal features of the performance text analysis; to help students to understand how those features structure the theatrical event/experience; and to offer students a sampling of theatrical styles/genres.", "topic": "Influence &
