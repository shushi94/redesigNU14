Class \ndismissed! \n \nNot really. \n \nWarren has a point: blackness is, after all, defined by history. There was no \nsuch notion of racial differences, as we understand them today, just a few hun- \ndred years ago. It was European scientists' technological advances, their cul- \ntures' lack of sanitary practices (and thus the spread of disease to Amerindians), \nits nations' lack of human rights, its merchants' and rulers' hunger for gold, its \npeoples' new addictions to tobacco, sugar and desire for cotton clothing that in- \nvented the \"Negro\"a being supposedly marked by Nature as a beast of burden \nfor the white man's civilization. \n \nBlackness, then is not so much a what as a when: like most Western literatures, \nAfrican American literature is often framed through timei.e., historical eras. \nYet perhaps more so than the writers from most \"majority\" literatures, who rarely feel the need to respond to calumny from another group, a new peoples in the midst of their formation found that they were already being spoken for and defined; even abolitionist discourse assumed their inferiority. It was crucial to \"write back\" -and not only be read, but capable of changing deeply held convictions on white superiority.\n \nHow did they do it? How did black Africans come to this nation labeled as non- \nhumans and within a few generations take African American literature on to the \nglobal stage to acclaim and respect? Is this literature's early goalhuman \nrightsso deeply embedded in its creative and philosophical DNA that, as \nWarren claims, it has become its sole signature print? \n\nThis course will take you from the first British ships' logs that recorded encoun- \nters with black Africans with a disturbing level of hatred and repulsion to the \nanarchic hedonism that marked the Harlem Renaissance far more than some of \nus would like to admit. While from its inception African American writing cer- \ntainly has served as the basis for so much of the West's notions of human rights \nand the violence of oppression, we must ask if Warren's claims are correct: if \nthis literary tradition, as we know it, cannot survive or be defined without mak- \ning explicit ties to the cause of equality.  \n \nWe will tread through three significant eras of early African American litera- \nture: the slave narrative, the turn of the century \"race novel\", and the Harlem \nRenaissance to test Warren's claims and work to uncover the historical, social, \ncultural and intellectual tumults that enabled an entire genre of distinct and ex- \npressive art to emerge.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 23112, "course_id": 1187, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Jordan, Winthrop.

Who is black? Why? Why do we treat race as a biological category when it has no genetic component (including the old myths of sickle cell anemia being a \"black\" disease) when, in fact, we \"know better\"? \n \nIs President Obama black in a different way from \"most\" African Americans? What roles do ancestry, geographic origin and cultural upbringing play in our understanding of \"blackness\"? Andperhaps most troubling of allto what degree is individual expression and diversity sacrificed in the name of racial solidarity? \n \nIn recent years this question has increasingly been explored through two formations: \"post blackness\" and \"Middle Passage Blackness\" (Obama, for example, purportedly belongs to the former but not the latter). \n \nWe will begin with two competing books on the meaning and phenomenon of \"post blackness\" by journalist Ytasha Womack and cultural critic Tour, both of whom argue that \"post blackness\" is a generational subversion: a new era, a new blackness. \n\nYet it is not as if these debates on blackness did not exist until recently, so we will then turn to one of the oldest and often least researched lines of difference between different African American communities: income and socioeconomic status. Using Patricia Williams' The Alchemy of Race and Rights and Ellis Cose's Rage of a Privileged Class, we will look at the ways in which money and blackness share a complex identity that, of course, goes all the way back to blacks being sold as commodities.  \n \nAs noted above, blackness is often posited as a biological, or \"essentialist\" identity, whereas anti-essentialists argue that blackness is an abstract category that changes radically through time and space. We will be using two Northwestern University professors' theories to look at how black-ness, regardless of how we define it, operates in both the physical and the abstract.  Professor Harvey Young's award-winning book Embodying the Black Experience, which looks at how we use and abuse the black body in our notions of race will be read alongside Professor Nitasha Sharma's Hip Hop Desis, in which blackness is vibrantly present amongst peoples and practices we may or may not call \"black\". \n \nFinally, with all of these notions and their rather heavy implications ironed oout in our class discussions, we will finish with cultural critic bell hooks' classic Black Looks, to both deploy and interrogate her assertion that there can be no peace, only war, between the black pop cultural icon and the non-black consumer seeking to \"eat the Other\".", "topic": null, "attributes": "Social & Behavioral Sciences Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26701, "course_id": 1195, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Womack, Ytasha.

This class will examine key moments and movements of 1968 and explore what, if anything, they had in common; it will consider how and why popular and youth protests spread across diverse societies in the late 1960s; it will highlight the noteworthy achievements of these rebellions and the hostile reactions they often provoked; and it will ask what became of the 1968 generation, investigating whether and why the ferment it represented soon faded from national and international politics. Throughout we will maintain a dual focus on the local and national origins, goals, and contexts of the various 1968 rebellions and the transnational and global dynamics that shaped them as we reflect on the interplay of national and transnational forces in contemporary world politics.

That is what Americans are experiencing as a result of the corporate media mergers that took place in the closing years of the last century.  Today there are six major companies that control much of what people read, hear and see.  Those firms are AOL-Time Warner, General Electric, Walt Disney, News Corporation, Viacom/CBS, and Bertelsman.\n\n                As the firms passed from largely family owned to publicly traded companies, the pressure for profit from Wall Street has led to cutbacks in the size of the firm's news divisions and a change in news story values that have \"softened\" the types of news that people see on television.\n\n                This course will begin with an examination of the monetary forces that are driving the industry away from its primary mission of information.  Critics, of whom the professor is one, contend that the drive for increasing profits is coming at the expense of both the quality and quantity of news that appear on television and radio, newspapers and magazines, and the Internet.  The ever-diminishing number of news providers is also threatening democracy by limiting the number of voices that can be heard in our society.\n\n                We will examine the impact of these mergers on several areas of news coverage and public discussion:\n                1.Privacy and scandal, particularly the stories about President Bill Clinton. \n                2.

As students of South Asian cultures, how do we make sense of this shift, if there is indeed one?  Is there an influence in South Asian scholarship of the changes taking place in the broader field of anthropology, or is there something specific to the region's postcolonial modernity that demands such a move? What is new about these emergent themes and how could they be read in light of canonical interests of South Asian anthropology?

Early declarations of the state's growing irrelevance in an era of globalization have proven to be grossly premature, as any migrant worker, prisoner, Palestinian struggling for statehood, South Sudanese celebrating statehood, or person in line at the Department of Motor Vehicles will tell you.  Yet many questions abound.  Is the nature of the state/subject relations changing with neoliberal globalization and if so, how?  What might be similar across different state/subject formations, and what might be different - not only in this particular historical juncture but in previous ones as well?  Do certain state/subject relations inhere in the very structure of the modern state and/or can we disrupt the universalist notion of the modern state as a Western form that takes \"alternative\" shape in different regions?  How can we think about the state, both ethnographically and theoretically, in ways that do not always presume the state as an agent, a monolith, or a set of always coherent projects?  What are the myriad ways that state projects shape particular subjects, and is this shaping always complete?  What fissures appear and how?  How do people engage or circumvent the state in their daily lives and in particular political struggles in ways that disrupt or collude with subject-making projects?  Key themes to be explored include governmentality, sovereignty, citizenship, rights, materiality, space, and development.

On an empirical level this may be because archaeological remains of houses are ubiquitous in the archaeological record: what site doesn't have houses?  On a theoretical level this may be because studies of households lead us to focus on the archaeological record as a peopled place.  Thus despite its short history, household archaeology has taken a leading role in epistemological shifts which place people and their practices and differences at the center of archaeological interpretations of the past, rather than subsuming these into the \"noise\" of passive and depersonalized depictions of ancient social systems.\n\nHouseholds and daily life are critical aspects of human existence.  Despite the pervasiveness of households in human societies, social theorists have not always examined households in a systematic fashion and consequently have tended to model human societies as large-scale systems, structures, or institutions devoid of human action and agency.  The study of households directly evokes the activities, social relations, gender relations, and interpersonal relations of people in the past.  It draws our attention from the extraordinary people in society, often leaders or important men, whose agency tends to be acknowledged by social theorists, to all people, inclusive of leaders and ordinary people.  Through the study of households we can begin to model the roles that all people played in their societies.\n\nThis class will try to demonstrate that the field of household archaeology has led to the development of theoretically rich and empirically substantive understandings of ancient societies.  But household archaeology is not without its detractors and these detractors are often quite hostile to household archaeology.  We will also explore anti-household archaeology thought.\n\nThis class is designed to be a forum for collaborative discussion and debate on central issues in contemporary archaeology.

Even in our lives today, distinction between city and country holds such deep meaning and sentiment that often it has been difficult for scholars to untangle `our' understandings of these places from those of the people whom we study in different places and time periods.

Understanding how European encounters with cultures spanning the globe conditioned politics and trade alike and the roles representation played in those encounters is key to the history of the making and meaning of works of art produced and traded in such global capitals as Amsterdam, Constantinople, London, and Isfahan, for example. This course will focus on European paintings, drawings, prints and illustrated books and maps, sculpted and carved objects, luxury products such as lacquerware and porcelain, and architecture. We will also explore non-European production with regard to transcultural exchange and as export product.

The ultimate product of the seminar will be a span of papers to guide the event, to be written in teams, for example:\nCeremonial Scenario - where the world leaders gather as a group to hold discussions, to hold receptions, to hold press conferences.\n\nWhere to set up television stands to record events.  Where direct interviews for \"candid\" interactions with the populace.  \nWorld Leader visits - what hotel to stay in, what quarter of the city to visit - both in Chicago and in the region.  Each leader separately.\nWhere should President Obama stay, where receive his distinguished guests, what take world leaders to see.\nCultural attachs - what itinerary they should be offered.  \nDitto political attachs, foreign press.\nWhat the world leaders should be told about Chicago, in a booklet, in a short movie.\nWhere to mount demonstrations - and the issues to be demonstrated about. \nThe history of Chicago as a demonstration field - Democratic Convention 1968.\nThe resulting scenarios and information files will be presented or discussion during the last meeting of the seminar during reading week, March 9.based on reading summaries, preliminary drafts of the G8 papers and the final version.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22566, "course_id": 18461, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "based on reading summaries, preliminary drafts of the G8 papers and the final version."}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Museums", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Janice A Katz", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "ART_HIST", "catalog_num": "395-0", "section": "20", "room": "View Class Details for Room", "meeting_days": "Tu", "start_time": "13:00:00", "end_time": "16:00:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 12, "overview": "JAPANESE WOODBLOCK PRINTS:  From 1660 to the Present\n\nDESCRIPTION:  The production of commercial prints in Japan was the result of a popular revolution in Japanese society. Japan's great premodern cities, especially Edo (now Tokyo), were home to increasingly prosperous, sophisticated, and literate urban dwellers who had voracious appetites for images of their favorite celebrities of the day or the latest illustrated novel.  This class will explore the birth of the commercial Japanese print, and its many incarnations leading to the designs of contemporary artists. During our discussions we will consider the changing role of the artist and issues of use and reception, including the part the West played in maintaining the popularity of Japanese prints into the 20th century.\n\n            Along with art historical analysis and a study of the commercial context of the prints, issues of connoisseurship will feature strongly in this class taught from a curatorial point of view. As this class will be conducted largely in the Art Institute's Japanese print storage area, it will be a rare opportunity to view works of art up close and unframed, essential for an understanding of printing techniques and collecting practices.\n\nPlease note:  This class will take place at the Art Institute of Chicago", "topic": "Japanese Woodblock Prints", "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26678, "course_id": 13192, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Internship in the Arts", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Hannah J Feldman", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "ART_HIST", "catalog_num": "396-0", "section": "20", "room": "TBA", "meeting_days": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 10, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22390, "course_id": 1276, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Studies in Representation", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Sarah Elizabeth Fraser", "bio": "Sarah E.

What we will aspire to achieve is what cultural theorist Walter Mignolo has referred to as an epistemic \"de-linking\" that severs assumptions regarding rationality and modernity from coloniality and from the implications the latter has held for shaping disciplinary paradigms within the American academy. Students from areas of study beyond art history are thus encouraged to enroll, provided that their work engages cultural objects and that it is their investment in cultural practice that grounds their study of the particularities of a particular place, region, or period of history. Our study will bring us into contact and dialogue with important historical and theoretical texts that form this new arena of study and we will use these to help us understand the transverse and transnational patterns of exchange that have animated cultural production around the globe since the mid-20th century, often to the exclusion of colonial centers. Students will be asked to search out and bring in examples of this production as related to their own areas of research and to use these to help ground and understand the texts we read. Proceeding in this manner will also force us to keep our attention focused on what might be the limits and the drawbacks of decoloniality as an epistemological tool as we try to speak productively across disciplines without an inherited or imposed investment in the same histories, canons, or methods. Final papers may take the form of research projects or may focus more explicitly on the specific analysis of an object or a text that contributes to the decolonial project and engages the significance of transverse or transnational models of cultural production and reception.", "topic": "Transnationalism&Decoloniality", "attributes": "No P/N option for this section\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22292, "course_id": 1290, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Course packet from Quartet"}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Internship in the Arts", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Huey Gene Copeland II", "bio": null, "address": "3-117 Crowe Hall", "phone": "847/467-5798", "office_hours": "TBA"}, "subject": "ART_HIST", "catalog_num": "496-0", "section": "20", "room": "TBA", "meeting_days": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 10, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 20489, "course_id": 1298, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Teaching Assistantship In Art History", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Huey Gene Copeland II", "bio": null, "address": "3-117 Crowe Hall", "phone": "847/467-5798", "office_hours": "TBA"}, "subject": "ART_HIST", "catalog_num": "570-0", "section": "20", "room": "TBA", "meeting_days": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 20, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 21492, "course_id": 8744, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Introduction to Asian American History", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Ji-Yeon Yuh", "bio": "Ji-Yeon Yuh is a native of Seoul and Chicago, a former journalist, and a mother of three.

Students are required to complete substantial programming assignments.\nWe begin the course by installing the Java software (JDK and JRE), and discussing the Java architecture.  Our first lectures cover Java variable declaration and initialization, and basic input/output.  From there we move on to Java conditional statements (if, if else, if else if, and switch).  Next, we cover the iterations available in Java: while, do while and for.  We conclude the course by covering the basics of arrays, a GUI interface and objects. Typically, course assignments include four open-book quizzes and six programming asssignments.  The programming assignments usually include at least four indiviudual programs.  The final programming assignment covers the entire course and is a program you can design yourself.

From early in the reign of the first emperor, Augustus, the imperial regime attempted to represent the emperor as an ideal ruler and to provide specific shape to his public image. In addition, a wide range of individuals and groups within the Roman state and the Empire at large--historians, poets, the Senate, the urban plebs, provincial communities large and small--sought to define the \"good\" emperor in precise terms, and to reward (and prescribe) ideal imperial behavior, while at times censuring the behavior of emperors perceived as \"bad.\" \"Roman imperial ideology,\" then, refers both to the system of ideals and values associated with the emperor, and to the ways in which these ideals and values served to legitimate and reinforce a dominant political and social order.

We will also examine the intertextuality between these genreshow poetry blends into narrative, how fiction becomes drama, and drama inspires fiction. Through reading these selected works of traditional Chinese literature, we will examine some of the major features of traditional Chinese society: religious and philosophical beliefs, the imperial system and dynastic change, gender relations, notions of class and ethnicity, family, romance and sexuality.

The second unit will then read cosmopolitanism from the perspective of modern Middle Eastern literature, focusing on the (dis)continuities between the cosmopolitan ideal and a globalized reality. \n\nThrough our readings, we will ask: does world citizenship negate other forms of belonging, such as to a nation or a locality? Is being a citizen of the world the privilege of an elite few, or the burden of many? Is it possible to envision multiple cosmopolitanisms, originating from different perspectives? We will also investigate alternative frameworks for understanding world belonging, such as international justice, political Islam, and human rights.

More than other filmmakers, he has shown us that modernity might be a matter of style.  Through experimental approaches to color and sound, through the imaginative reframing of space and time, his films eschew the familiar narrative conventions of clich humanism or the psychological drama of the unconscious.  He thus set out to visualize new modes of experience while calling into question outdated visual and social conventions.  Indeed, Antonioni's cinema may be said to redefine decisively the roles of gender, sexuality, ecology, technology, architecture and fashion in contemporary society.  What does it mean in formal and aesthetic terms to be in this sense a paradigmatic modernist filmmaker?

Assignments will be adjusted in content and complexity according to student background.\n      Phase One: reviews the fundamental mechanics of sound production and bow strokes through sequenced hands-on experiences (bow only).  Phase Two: involves the application and identification of these principles in selected studies and excerpts.  Phase Three: is devoted to the communication and evaluation of bowing as it relates to interpretation as well as the protocol of the rehearsal process.  The final project is a bowing analysis of a symphonic work which is presented to the class for discussion and feedback.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 25836, "course_id": 8677, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "All are available at Norris Bookstore, can be ordered directly from suppliers indicated, or are on reserve in my studio.\n\n* Berman, J., Jackson, B., & Sarch, K.; Dictionary of Bowing and Pizzicato Terms, 4th. ed., (1999), available through ASTA-NSOA publications.

After traditional hydrocarbons become economically unaffordable or exceedingly dangerous to the environment and national security, planet Earth will remain central to human sustenance because renewable energy from wind, solar, biofuels, tides, and geothermal heat are similarly linked to natural sources from the sun and Earth. Technology will also play an important role in harnessing energy from photovoltaic arrays, fission, fusion, and energy carriers such as hydrogen.

This course begins with an atomistic approach to understanding mineral properties, but also extends physical properties and mineral stability to the larger geological and planetary scales. The properties of minerals also dictate how we use them for societal applications, ranging from raw materials to chemical filters and energy sources and storage materials. Mineralogy is the application of physics, chemistry, and biology to natural materials, and this course emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of mineralogy.

Previously, legal study had focused on individual cases, considered issues of equity, and was thus backward looking-who should win a particular case narrowly considered?  Given that every court case concerns past events that cannot now be changed, issues of efficiency seemed absent.  Cases were categorized into cells-criminal, contracts, antitrust, and so on.  Understanding the law categorized in one cell did little to help understand another cell.  In brief, traditional legal study was filled with data (cases) for which it had no generally agreed explanatory model.  <br />In contrast, law & economics begins with the usual economic assumption that rational actors maximize utility subject to constraint-market constraints (as in most economics courses) but also legal constraints regarding permitted and forbidden behavior.  L&E is forward looking-in the case at bar, how (if at all) will ruling for one litigant affect behavior of potential future litigants who are not in the courtroom and cannot even be identified at present, indeed, who may still be unborn?  Many important choices are yet to be made by those parties, so efficiency issues loom large.  The wealth of legal data (cases) can then be used to test the model.  A similar perspective can be applied to statutory law, and even to informal societal norms.

Ideally this course will bring together people with strong programming skills, with people with a strong need for solving compute-intensive programs that can potentially benefit from programming graphics processors. The initial part of the course will discuss a popular programming interface for graphics processors, the CUDA programming tools for NVIDIA processors. The course will continue with a closer view of the internal organization of graphics processors and how it impacts performance. Finally, implementations of applications and algorithms on graphics processors will be discussed.", "topic": "Programmming Massively Parallel Processors", "attributes": "Prerequisites apply, see description\n\nNo P/N option for this section\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 24141, "course_id": 4994, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "Homework Assignments\nThere will be several programming assignments.

Particles and Movement: 1) Abandon all polygons to make 'shapeless' shapes (fireworks, swarms of bees, rain, snow, grass, etc.) from clouds of particles. How close can we get to modeling each particle in a cloud of steam? 2) Moving particles coupled together can simulate many interesting materials (rope, water, smoke, cloth, etc.). We'll explore both 'explicit' and 'implicit' solvers that make soft things move and behave realistically. B. Light Done Right: we'll learn ray tracing, BRDFs and light units, extended light sources (soft shadows), and some basic global illumination ideas. You will make pictures that look much more like photographs than OpenGL, with shadows, chrome reflections, transparency, and complex surfaces."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc":

Whether whale, bear, horse, or dog, animals have long served as figures of mystery, terror, honor, and affection in American literature. Noble or depraved, though, they are never without the weight of metaphor as authors from Dickinson to Faulkner have sought to capture the animal Other. This course seeks to free those creatures from their metaphorical pens in order to explore \"the question of the animal\" in American writing. Following the growing interest in the field of animal studies, we will investigate representations of animals and animal-human relations from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. By examining the social and ethical stakes of what it means to write the animal into being, we will question the ways in which these depictions shape and are shaped by other key categories of representation, such as race, gender, and national identity. We will concentrate our attention on the creaturely life in two texts inseparable from their animal protagonists, Herman Melville's Moby Dick and William Faulkner's \"The Bear.\" In our hunt for answers, we will target three central questions: what recurrent themes, images, and concerns shape depictions of animals in American literature of this period? How have writings about animals evolved since the mid-19th century?

You will learn how Mozart shaped his dramatic effects through musical devices that operate at the level of the aria or ensemble, the scene, and the act.\n\nThe course is called \"The Triumph of Love\" because that is what Mozart's operas are about in a very explicit and programmatic manner that is part of the sentimental side of Enlightenment thought. The happy endings of his operas turn very explicitly on acts of love or forgiveness, except for Don Giovanni, which makes its composer's point in a negative way: it is quite literally an \"opera without love.\" The course begins with The Abduction from the Seraglio, Mozart's first popular success and most accessible work.  It is a Singspiel, not unlike a modern musical, with its libretto in the vernacular, i.e. German.

Which parts have you heard about but still do not know</li>\n<li>What does being part of the \"Northwestern Community\" mean to you</li>\n<li>Is \"community\" a vibrant force at Northwestern, or is it something you believe we are lacking</li> \n<li>What do you mean  (think, feel) when you describe yourself as a \"Northwestern student\"? How is being a Northwestern student an aspect of your identity? How do people enact identities in mundane contexts</li>\n</ul>\n\nAt the same time, we will explore how people write about place, community and identity. To start, we will focus on description and narration, looking at NU as a place (and our place). Then we will use a variety of readings to define \"community,\" examine how community shapes (or fails to shape) notions of self, and explore what it means to be excluded from a community and whether it is difficult to re-enter a community one has left. In this segment of the course we will think about students but also veterans, expatriates, and former prisoners. Finally, to gain a fuller picture of Northwestern, we will use interviews, surveys, ethnographic observations, and site visits to investigate other students' opinions about Northwestern and to explore different residence halls, schools, campus organizations and our professional schools in Chicago.

Our class will consider questions like the following:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Now that you have been at Northwestern since September, which parts the campus are you familiar with</li>\n <li>Do any feel like \"home\"? Which parts have you heard about but still do not know</li>\n<li>What does being part of the \"Northwestern Community\" mean to you</li>\n<li>Is \"community\" a vibrant force at Northwestern, or is it something you believe we are lacking</li> \n<li>What do you mean  (think, feel) when you describe yourself as a \"Northwestern student\"? How is being a Northwestern student an aspect of your identity? How do people enact identities in mundane contexts</li>\n</ul>\n\nAt the same time, we will explore how people write about place, community and identity. To start, we will focus on description and narration, looking at NU as a place (and our place). Then we will use a variety of readings to define \"community,\" examine how community shapes (or fails to shape) notions of self, and explore what it means to be excluded from a community and whether it is difficult to re-enter a community one has left. In this segment of the course we will think about students but also veterans, expatriates, and former prisoners. Finally, to gain a fuller picture of Northwestern, we will use interviews, surveys, ethnographic observations, and site visits to investigate other students' opinions about Northwestern and to explore different residence halls, schools, campus organizations and our professional schools in Chicago. At the same time that you develop your ideas about community and identity at NU, you will be writing stories, analyses, and arguments about what you discover, believe, and/or question.", "topic": "Exploring Northwestern:Campus Community, Identity", "attributes": null, "requirements": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen and Sophomores", "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22778, "course_id": 1770, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "Note: To add to the course focus on discovering Northwestern, classes will be held in the Allison Residential Community.

Gladwell calls this idea \"the power of thinking without thinking,\" and uses it to explain an astonishing variety of events, such as how an art museum paid $10 million for an obvious fake, how America elected its worst president (probably not the one you think), and why New York City police officers fired 41 bullets at an unarmed man. Instead of accepting or rejecting Gladwell's basic argument, this course uses the book as a starting point to dive into some of the provocative topics and people the book describes - among them gamblers, art forgers, musicians, firefighters, athletes, soldiers, marriage counselors, and ordinary single people looking for a mate.\n\nEnglish 111 is a course in academic writing, and its purpose is mostly to prepare you to succeed in SCS or any other academic program where writing is important.  Although we'll focus on academic writing, the skills you will develop - critical reading, summary, argument, research - are useful for any serious writing. My aim is to help you develop skills you can apply to any writing task, academic or not.  Writers need something to write about, and in this course we'll use Malcolm Gladwell's 2005 bestseller Blink as the basis for our work (partly because it's interesting, partly because it's an example of good writing).  We will start by reading and writing about the book itself, and in the second half of the course students will pursue their own research and writing projects on topics related to the book's themes.

We will pair them each with essential critical and theoretical statements in poetics. Our purpose is two-fold. First, we'll gain fluency with key issues and protagonists in modern poetry and poetics; second, we'll experiment widely and self-consciously with different practices of reading. When confronting a poem, we will learn to shuttle with agility between the observations of minute formal elements and larger historical logics. We will practice the fundamentals of \"close reading,\" but we will also flirt with alternatives such as \"close listening\" and \"wild reading.\" We will move between an understanding of a \"text\" and its social \"context,\" between discrete \"works\" and the wider \"networks\" of poems to which they belong.

How do literary standards work to constitute values?); and ideological content (How do we judge a text's position in relation to historical and contemporary political issues, including--but not limited to--matters of gender, race and class?). Our focusing lens is the theme of criminality: What counts as transgression against norms, both within texts (Who are the criminals? Who makes the laws? What is appropriate punishment for crimes?) and in our wider literary culture (What makes a text obscene and therefore criminal? What makes a text worthy or unworthy of serious consideration?

We will be read examples of fabulism as writers read: to understand how these fictions are madestudying them from the inside out so, to speak.  Many of these genres overlap.  For instance they are all rooted in the tale, a kind of story that goes back to primitive sources.  They all speculate: they ask the question What If? They all are stories that demand invention, which, along with the word transformation, will be the key terms in the course.  The invention might be a monster, a method of time travel, an alien world, etc. but with rare exception the story will demand an invention and that invention will often also be the central image of the story.  So, in discussing how these stories work we will also be learning some of the most basic, primitive moves in storytelling.  To get you going I will be bringing in exercises that employ fabulist techniques and hopefully will promote stories.  These time tested techniques will be your entrancesyour rabbit holes and magic doorways--into the figurative.

Methodologically, we will attempt to navigate between two radically different accounts of virtuality:  a poststructuralist account, in which the illusion of presence promised by modern virtual-reality technology is no more than an extension of the phenomenological paradox (of simultaneous presence and absence) built into the very first technological apparatus, language; and an historicist account (derived from the work of Walter Benjamin), in which virtuality is the residue of certain nineteenth-century technological developments (mass-publishing, the photograph and phonograph, etc.), a history which culminates in our own era's digitalization of information.

Controversial as that claim is, the literature of this period engages profoundly interrelated conflicts--violent and nonviolent, domestic and international--in many forms and on many fronts: the racialized military, economic, and cultural violence of European empires in Ireland, Africa, and India; economic instability, social upheaval, contestation over economic and political systems; rising dictatorships, the Great War, the Spanish Civil War, World War II; civil war, racism, antisemitism, other instances of barbarism within nations or societies; national and international workers', peace, and women's movements; colonial resistance, postcolonial independence, decolonization, Cold War neocolonialism; tensions between a declining \"west\" and various rising \"non-wests.\"\n\nIn this seminar we'll study key literary works of several moments, perspectives, and genres in light of the conflict(s) they represent or register; the historical conditions and events surrounding their genesis; and the representational problematics, means (e.g., medium, tradition, genre or subgenre, language, form, discourse), and strategies (e.g., voice, intertextuality, audiences ideal and actual) each work engages. We'll analyze ways in which they represent, witness, participate in, and/or meditate upon historical conflicts, and we'll consider the often remarked \"difficulty\" of twentieth-century literature in light of aesthetic and ethical dimensions of (fictions of) transparency. Putting literary works in dialogue with historical documents, critical accounts, and theoretical texts, we'll explore what Edward Said described as \"worldly\" aesthetic and critical practices arising in this period of rapid technological, economic, political, and social change.

As such, it faced aesthetic, moral, intellectual and official opposition. At best, it was considered frivolous and immoral. The government was weary of it and the rationally minded argued that the imagination, a faculty that was highly suspect, undermined intellectual rigor. Authors themselves were unlikely to praise narrative fiction as a serious means. But the novel, which for the first time (and for no wonder) achieved mass appeal during the Enlightenment, was an integral part of an intellectual system whose aim it was to promote a belief in reason and a critical appraisal of existing ideals and institutions. In contrast to their philosophical treatises, philosophers' fictions from the eighteenth century often relied on humor, irony and fictitious scandal (the shock factor) to convey their messages. This course will explore the relationship between the novel and other forms of ethical rhetoric, including philosophical treatises and personal correspondence. The readings will be heavily weighted on fiction, but excerpts from non-fictional works will be included in the syllabus in order to provide a context for discussion.\n\nThe syllabus includes only three authors: Montesquieu, Diderot and Voltaire. Each author will receive three weeks of our attention. By the end of the course, students should feel that they know these authors well, almost personally. They should also have acquired a broader view of the diversity of form in eighteenth-century fictional narratives, as well as of the genre's tactical purposes.", "topic": "Philosophers' Fictions in the Republic of Letters", "attributes": null, "requirements": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen and Sophomores", "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22511, "course_id": 2985, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "<ul>\n<li>Montesquieu - <em>Persian Letters, Spirit of the Laws,</em> excerpts, Selected correspondence</li>\n<li>Diderot - Jacques the Fatalist, Encylclopedia, selected entrees, Selected correspondence</li>\n<li>Voltaire - <em>Candide, Zadig, and Selected Stories, The Calas Affair,</em> Selected correspondence</li>\n</ul>\nThe three novels are available at the bookstore in the Norris Student Center.

Our readings will include poetry, prose, theater and film.  We will discuss themes, images and language that draw a connection between love and death.  What roles do fate, chance and free will have when one confronts love and death?  Is it possible to overcome the supreme power that both exercise over man?

He was as deeply concerned by the transformations taking place in the cultural sphere, where he believed culture itself, the period's emotional and aesthetic response to the conditions and relations of everyday life, was being appropriated in the service of the emerging consumer society. Debord considered himself at war with that society and saw his entire life as a strategy in that war. With others in the group he helped found in 1957, the International Situationists, he developed a radical understanding of the relation between art and culture and of the role intellectuals and artists might play in the cultural revolution he aimed to provoke. Debord was a prolific composer of tracts, articles, reviews, books, memoirs, and films. We focus on him but also read pieces by others in the IS.

The course is designed to provide opportunities for music aficionados to experience music and music theater events from the inside-out.  The only prerequisite for the course is a love of the performing arts  --  you don't have to read, perform, or understand music notation to succeed in this course.  However, you have to be prepared to spend a lot of time attending rehearsals and concerts (minimally six hours a week), outside of the two required class sessions.  During the in-and-outside of classroom sessions, the instructor and invited guests will attempt to nurture a heightened awareness of the challenges that conductors, opera and music theater directors and musicians/actors face when preparing for a performance.  Through a series of observations, presentations, interviews, and interactive discussions/seminars, you will be better prepared to listen, observe, and critically analyze performing arts events on and off campus -- during this academic quarter, and hopefully for the rest of your life.\n\nAfter Week One's introduction to the course and the music library,  the Week Two class sessions will concentrate on conducting lessons and video observations of concerts and rehearsals.  In these initial sessions, you will learn many of the techniques needed to lead the world's greatest instrumental and choral ensembles (of course, with many additional years of practice).  Course participants, using their required conductor's baton and music CD's will learn a variety of conducting techniques  --   mastering beat patterns, the expressive use of the left hand, and using the conducting gesture to communicate \"interpretation,\" \"phrasing,\" and \"dynamic shading.\"  You may never conduct a major ensemble, but after meeting the requirements of the class you should have the knowledge and understanding to critically analyze conductors during your future career as a member of audiences for classical and popular music concerts\n\n\n\nProjects and Evaluation Method\n\n\nAn individualized assessment contract will be negotiated during the first two weeks of the quarter to address the creative, musical or scholarly interests of students enrolled in the class.  Specific assignments and projects will be determined after a private conference with Professor Dobroski.   In general, evaluation will be based on engagement in the various course components, including 1) completion of weekly readings, listening assignments, and participation in class discussions to be registered in a course log to be submitted Feb.  7 and March 12th  (20% of final grade); 2) attendance and a written analysis/critique-reactions to eight rehearsals and eight concerts (20% of final grade); 3) preparation of  a collaborative oral/written presentation on music from  the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth or the twentieth century (15%); 4) the preparation of program notes for two compositions being performed at a student solo or chamber music recital this academic quarter with the expectation of having to observe two rehearsals and attend the recital of your \"assigned\" student (15%); 5) the observation of a \"master\" professor in an applied lesson, and/or a class environment, (you will be asked to submit a  brief paper reflecting your observations/impressions. (15%); and  6)  prepare a final research paper and  oral presentation on a topic related to a composer or composition being performed by a School of Music ensemble this quarter (15%).   Again, the choice of assignments will be discussed during our individual appointments at the end of Week One or the beginning of Week Two.\n\nThere will be frequent exchanges with the instructor to insure formative and summative evaluative communication through the Winter Quarter.\n\n\n\nCourse Outline (Weeks One, Two and Three)\n\nAfter meeting with members of the class in private conferences Dr. Dobroski will re-issue and distribute a revised course schedule (see Handout Two:  Weekly Schedule and Initial Assignments, distributed during the second class", "topic": "A Journey From First Rehearsal to Final Performanc", "attributes": null, "requirements": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen and Sophomores", "component": "LEC", "class_num": 25722, "course_id": 3484, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "desc": "Additional recommended books, articles, CD's, DVD's  and VCR's will be provided by the instructor or placed on reserve in the library.\nRecommended Websites for Periodic Reference and Review\n\n\tMusical America:  http://www.musicalamerica.com\n\tAndante Magazine:  http://www.andante.com)\n\tWeb Sites referenced on pp. 432-436 in the Kerman/Tomlinson text"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Kerman, Joseph and Tomlinson.

Particular attention is paid to the work of Franz Kafka and the paintings of Marc Chagall.  In addition, the class will examine the place of Klezmer music in Yiddish culture and that of \"high\" classical music (such as the works of Felix Mendelssohn and Gustav Mahler) in the German-Jewish experience.  \n\nWe begin with a series of short stories and then turn to two short travel-novels, Mendele Mocher Sforim's Travels and (excerpts from) Kafka's Amerika. Later in the quarter we focus on drama and film, including Scholem Aleichem's Tevye, the Dairyman (made into the popular film, Fiddler on the Roof), and two plays about dreaming:  Richard Beer-Hofmann, Jacob's Dream and S.

For the second stage, a variety of current short texts (current texts from newspapers and magazines as well as fictional works by German-speaking authors) serve as a basis for writing exercises and other assignments that build on the first stage. For example, if students have particular problems with adjective endings, we will quickly review them. We will then continue discussing adjective endings with plural expressions such as viele (many), mehrere (several), and einige (some); we will cover adjectival use of present and past participles; and then move on to extended adjectival modifiers.  \n\nThe second component in this class gives students a chance to work on a longer piece of writing over the nine weeks of the quarter. The goals for the writing component of the course are threefold: a) students produce a large amount of high quality writing while constantly revising, rereading, adjusting; b) students get involved in research by working on topics they would not have been interested in before, simply because it concerns the person they are writing about; c) students share their work throughout the quarter with their class peers, their teacher and their mentor outside of class.

It focuses on the obstinate obtrusiveness of objects, which refuse to disappear into their automatic, unconscious functionality, instead remaining annoyingly conspicuous. This form of active resistance implies the ascription of agency to the malfunctioning, disruptive object, which seems to willfully interrupt the subject's plans and intentions and thereby causing outbursts of anger and rage. These often grotesque explosions, if perceived from an \"innocent by-stander,\" appear as highly comical - a phenomenon that is most famously exploited in slapstick routines. Things are not merely inanimate, passive objects but become active agents in what the French sociologist and philosopher Bruno Latour has named a network of actors. What does it mean to be a subject?

That \"pure beauty\" triumphs and wins the prince may be satisfying, but why should the hapless and unsuspecting Snow White be graced while her stepmother (who worked hard in her dungeon concocting potions and lotions) be denied success?  After all, isn't beauty (both inner and outer) a goal to be attained?  Or is it only the assets with which one is born? Although we know that the discourse of beauty is paradoxical and self-contradictory, and perhaps we accept it grudgingly, but is it a worthy site of political struggle? \n\tUsing the cosmetic industry (including plastic surgery) as a case study and applying critical frameworks developed by writers and theorists as different as Naomi Wolf, Susan Bordo, bell hooks, and Judith Butler, this course asks why has there been such heated disputes among feminists over whether the beauty industry is oppressive or liberatory.  Is it the source of delusion and false values or the source of self-expression and empowerment?  Could it be a site of critical destabilizing practices?  To better understand the deeper stakes in this debate, the class situates these questions historically, tracing them from 17th and 18th century moral philosophy and aesthetics to 19th century anthropology, medicine, phrenology, and comparative anatomy.  A crucial component of this project is to uncover how elites as spectators, philosophers, connoisseurs, and scientists constituted racial and sexual hierarchies through aesthetic judgment.\n\tThroughout, we will be attuned to the counter-discourses and self-fashioning strategies of marginalized groups and individuals.

As we'll see, instabilities in feminist theory percolate not only out of restless efforts to complicate the categories of \"gender,\" \"sex,\" and \"sexuality,\" but also from attempts to clarify the meaning of \"feminism\" as a political project geared toward interrogating power, oppression, and domination in the name of relations, commitments, and goals worth fighting for. We'll start with the encounter between \"difference\" and \"diversity\" feminisms that partly defined the immediate post-Beauvoir scene, bringing Anglo-American standpoint theorists into confrontation with black and Chicana (mestizaje) theorists as \"the outsiders within.\"  From there we go to other sites of unrest: the tension between the demands of compulsory heterosexuality and \"lesbian existence\" that initiates the \"sex wars\"; the confrontation between cultural feminists and postmodern (or deconstructive) theorists that enflames the identity crisis of feminism's \"subject\"; the clash between feminist and queer theory that triggers \"gender trouble\" - including demands to \"take a break\" from feminism - and, finally, to the disorders manifested in the \"multicultural\" debates between global (Western liberal democratic) and post-colonial (Third World subaltern) feminisms.

Because violence involves at least three, sometimes overlapping, perspectives: perpetrators, victims, and witnesses, explaining its causes and consequences of violence must address historically specific dimensions of motivation and constraint. With this approach to violence we can think about the ways in which struggles over the morality and legitimacy of force shaped both new and enduring forms of violence in African history. We'll work our way toward answers--actually, better questions are better than answers--by considering slavery and slave trading in West Africa, imperial conquest and colonial power in East Africa, and genocidal violence in Rwanda.", "topic": "Violence and African History", "attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory\n\nFreshmen/Sophomores Only\n\n", "requirements": "Enrollment Requirements: Reserved for Freshmen and Sophomores", "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26893, "course_id": 2029, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "HISTORY AREA OF CONCENTRATION:  Africa/Middle East<br />\nThis class is administered by the WCAS Office of Undergraduate Studies and Advising"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Saidiya Hartmann, Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route (Farrar Strauss Giroux, 2007, ISBN 9780374531157)<br />\nDavid Anderson, Histories of the Hanged (W.W.

They reflect traditions that are much older, and draw upon legends widely repeated I such diverse regions as China, India, Iran and Turkey. Analysts of pre-modern societies in the Islamic world now recognize The Arabian Nights as a major literary source that sheds light on many types of colorful people whose antics enlivened the scene in great Islamic cities of pre-modern times, but who remain largely invisible I more formal sources. The Nights also raise issues of cultural practice that contrast with formal strictures imposed by such sacred texts as the Koran itself. The fact that the stories were allegedly told by a woman conniving to stave off vengeance killings by a ruler raises intriguing questions about male-female relations.

The more Americans debate its lessons, the more conflicted they become. Part of the problem is that there were multiple Vietnam Wars - wars following wars and wars within wars - enlisting combatants from all over the world with differing agendas and points of view. This course will examine the most important of those conflicts and combatants in their full complexity, seeking to replace a history of overly simple binaries - Americans against Vietnamese, hawks versus doves, heroes versus villains - with a past in which such categories were intertwined, indistinct, and riven with contradictions. Among other questions we will consider how and why the United States intervened in Vietnam when it did and who made the decision for war, which Americans went to Vietnam and what they did there, the changing nature of U.S. involvement and its shifting rationale, and various efforts to end the war along with its lasting legacies. Whenever possible, it will use these questions to illuminate the inner workings of the Cold War and U.S. foreign relations since 1945 as well. Readings and lectures will explore the war's international, political, and cultural dimensions along with military strategy and battlefield conditions, using contemporary reporting, oral histories, official records, fiction, and film from the struggle, as well as historical scholarship.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Historical Studies Distro Area\n\nAttendance at 1st class mandatory\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26940, "course_id": 18805, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "AREA OF CONCENTRATION:  Americas or Asia/ME<br />\nAttendance at first class mandatory is applicable to enrolled, waitlsted and all potential students. <br />"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Christian Appy, Patriots: The Vietnam War Remembered From All Sides (Penguin USA, 2003, ISBN 9780142004494)<br />\nMark Bradley, Imagining Vietnam and America: The Making of Postcolonial Vietnam, 1919-1950 (Longleaf, 2000, ISBN 978-0807848616)<br />\nMichael Hunt, A Vietnam War Reader: A Documentary History From American and Vietnamese Perspectives (University of North Carolina Press/Longleaf, ISBN 978-0807859919)<br />\nGeorge C.

This humanities seminar focuses on the claims of literary cosmopolitanism, or \"cosmopolitan reading:\" the idea that in reading foreign literature, one enters into an international conversation that cultivates world citizenship. The first unit of the course will look at the role that Middle Eastern literatures and ideas of the \"East\" played in the formation of European concepts of cosmopolitanism. The second unit will then read cosmopolitanism from the perspective of modern Middle Eastern literature, focusing on the continuities and discontinuities between the cosmopolitan ideal and a globalized reality.\n \nThrough our readings, we will ask questions such as: does world citizenship negate other forms of belonging, such as to a nation or a locality? Is being a citizen of the world the privilege of an elite few, or the burden of many? Is it possible to envision multiple cosmopolitanisms, originating from different perspectives? We will also investigate alternative frameworks for understanding world belonging as they emerge from our readings, such as international justice, political Islam, and human rights. Highlighting links between the flows of people, capital, and literature, these works open up avenues for political and literary critique. In the end, they ask us to wonder: if world citizenship can be said to exist, whator whose\"world\" is it?", "topic": "Middle Eastern Literature and the World", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 22805, "course_id": 1444, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Lawrence Durrell, <em>Justine;</em> Ibrahim Abdel Meguid,<em>No One Sleeps in Alexandria;</em> Orhan Pamuk, <em>The White Castle;</em> Latife Tekin, <em>Berji Kristin: Tales from the Garbage Hills;</em> Ian McEwan;,<em>Saturday</em> Ahmed Alaidy, <em>Being Abbas el Abd</em>.

It focuses on the obstinate obtrusiveness of objects, which refuse to disappear into their automatic, unconscious functionality, instead remaining annoyingly conspicuous. This form of active resistance implies the ascription of agency to the malfunctioning, disruptive object, which seems to willfully interrupt the subject's plans and intentions and thereby causing outbursts of anger and rage. Things are not merely inanimate, passive objects but become active agents in what the French sociologist and philosopher Bruno Latour has named a network of actors. What does it mean to be a subject?

Marketing managers have unprecedented amounts of data available to assist them in making decisions.  Individuals who understand how to use data to make better decisions and support their arguments with evidence have a great advantage.  This class will focus on developing the following skills.1.\tYou should be able to communicate with members of a market research department.  Although most of you will not choose market research for a career, you will undoubtedly be required to work with a market research department at some time during your career.  It is therefore important that you know how to communicate with market researchers.  You will learn a vocabulary that can be used to describe data, e.g., average, median, quartiles, deciles, percentiles, standard deviations, margins of error.  You will also learn how market researchers think about marketing problems.  Learning these skills will enable you to express your research needs in a language that a market researcher will understand, which will allow you to work more productively and efficiently with them.  \n2.\tYou will learn to read, interpret, and use marketing research reports correctly.  For example, you will learn how to interpret a cross tabulation.  You will learn how to create visual displays of marketing data so that you can make more persuasive marketing presentations and reports.  You will also learn some of the background theory that supports these methods so that you will have a deeper understanding of them.  \n3.\tYou will learn how to use statistical software to run elementary market research reports from a database.

Good contracts protect the marketer, the company, and most importantly, the brand. Good business judgment requires an understanding of the basics of contract law.\n\n4. Intellectual Property, particularly copyright and trademark law. The marketing professional needs to know and understand what can and should be protected when it comes to the brand's assets, and how to protect those assets. Conversely, marketing professionals need to understand when and how they might infringe upon the protected assets of other brands.\nThe internet and technology have created a \"wild west\" atmosphere when it comes to intellectual property and the protection of brand assets. The law continues to evolve.\n\n5. Privacy. Privacy, too, lives in the technologically ever-changing wild west. There are laws that protect our privacy - sometimes but not always. There are other laws that protect the privacy of famous people but not the rest of us. Marketers need to know when they are in danger of violating the rights of the famous and not-so-famous alike. More importantly, technology has given marketers the ability to collect nearly unlimited information about all of us. The law is getting more and more restrictive as to how that information can be used. Good marketing and business decisions require a good understanding of this body of law. Without it, it's easier than you might think to get yourself and your employer into deep trouble.\n\n6. Ethics. It's very hard to draw a line between law and ethics. There is significant overlap. It's been said that the law is the minimum standard when it comes to ethics. Good marketing judgment and good marketing decisions require an appropriately developed appreciation of ethical marketing behavior. Specifically, we will explore the ethical dimensions of:\n\na. Communications practices\nb. Behavioral targeting\nc. Marketing to children \nd. Product marketing\n\nDecisions that cross legal or ethical lines are always bad business decisions, even if made out of ignorance or with the best of intentions. A knowledge and understanding of the areas outlined above will greatly enhance your business and marketing judgment. The ability to apply that good judgment will always result in better decisions and more effective and successful marketing efforts.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Attendance at 1st class mandatory\n\nNo P/N option for this section\n\nPermission of School\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26316, "course_id": 922, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "Registration for all graduate IMC courses is restricted and controlled by the Office of Student Life at Medill."}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "IMC Strategic Process", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "JOUR", "instructor": {"name": "Francis J Mulhern", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "IMC", "catalog_num": "460-0", "section": "20", "room": "McCormick Tribune 3119", "meeting_days": "TuFr", "start_time": "09:00:00", "end_time": "10:50:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 45, "overview": "This course discusses the principles and practices of Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC).

It will examine the humanitarian impulses that prompt nations to welcome refugees in need of protection, and the various influences (whether political, cultural, or religious) that help or hinder the development of national refugee programs.  The course will also consider proposals to transform the international protection regime, analyzing these propositions in light of current events that propel or deter migration. \n\nThe course will include four units.  The first will address the mass migrations that preceded and followed World War I, the forced migrations triggered by World War II, and the responses of the affected states and the nascent international community.  This historical background will lead into an examination of the institutional framework of refugee protection created by the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and the subsequent 1967 Protocol expanding the geographic and temporal reach of the Convention.  This unit will examine Cold War influences on the scope of protection, and will wrap-up with a case study of the international reaction to the refugee flows from Indochina in the 1970s and 1980s.  \n\nThe second unit will examine U.S. asylum policy in-depth to provide a solid grounding in how individual cases are adjudicated by a leading provider of refugee protection.  The Refugee Convention defines a refugee as one who has a well-founded fear of persecution based on one of five factors (race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group).  This unit will study the standards that must be met by asylum seekers, including the factors that may render an applicant ineligible.  The course will examine the five grounds of persecution in detail, considering how public attitudes and political movements may influence the scope of protection, including the rare but significant occasions where Congress has acted to increase access to protection for certain favored classes of asylum seekers and refugees.  This unit will include a case study on the evolving area of gender-based asylum claims.  Finally, this unit will compare the U.S. asylum adjudication system with the policies and practices of other leading resettlement states, such as Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe third unit of the course will address current international migration issues, including forms of protection available to migrants who may not meet the Convention definition of a refugee.  These include internally displaced persons and those fleeing natural disasters.  This unit will include a case study on the vexing challenge of asylum seekers who arrive by sea, and national reactions to that circumstance.  \n\nThe fourth unit will continue the focus on international issues by examining protracted refugee situations and the quest to find durable solutions.  It will consider a number of proposals for reform of the international protection regime, including mechanisms for burden sharing.  Finally, the course will analyze the ideological influences on resettlement programs, discussing how resettlement nations select refugees and the type of aid provided to those chosen for resettlement.", "topic": "Refugee Policy", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27360, "course_id": 3479, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Professor will prepare a course pack of readings.

From the American performance artist Cindy Sherman to German director Wim Wenders, American director Sofia Coppola, Hong-Kong director Wong Kar-wai, and Miuccia Prada, a number of the most creative figures of contemporary culture have named Antonioni as a crucial influence.  More than other filmmakers, he has shown us that modernity might be a matter of style.  Through experimental approaches to color and sound, through the imaginative reframing of space and time, his films eschew the familiar narrative conventions of clich humanism or the psychological drama of the unconscious.  He thus set out to visualize new modes of experience while calling into question outdated visual and social conventions.  Indeed, Antonioni's cinema may be said to redefine decisively the roles of gender, sexuality, ecology, technology, architecture and fashion in contemporary society.  What does it mean in formal and aesthetic terms to be in this sense a paradigmatic modernist filmmaker?  What lifestyles and forms of modern life - including mod culture in 1960s London, the 1968 youth movement in California, and modern nomadism - emerge in a new light thanks to his films?  Our discussion will address and expand upon these questions, paying particular attention to the following films: <em>L'avventura (1960), La Notte (1961), Eclipse (1962), Red Desert (1964), Blow-Up (1966), Zabriskie Point (1970), The Passenger (1975),</em> and <em>Identification of a Woman (1982).  </em>  In addition we'll consider Cindy Sherman, <em>Untitled Film Stills (1977-1980);</em> Wim Wenders, <em>Kings of the Road (1976) and Paris Texas (1984); </em> Sofia Coppola, <em>Lost in Translation (2003),</em> and Wong Kar-wai, <em>In The Mood for Love (2000). </em>", "topic": null, "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\nGiven in English\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26742, "course_id": 3106, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "All films will be available on blackboard. \n<strong>Taught in English</strong>, seminar style; no knowledge of Italian is necessary."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "<strong>Texts</strong>\n<ul><li>Seymour Chatman, <em>Antonioni, or The Surface of the World</em></li>\n<li>Peter Brunette, <em>The Films of Michelangelo Antonioni</em></li>\n<li>Reader at Quartet Copies</li>\n</ul>"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "Evaluation will focus on classroom participation (25%), a journal of film viewing (20%) one oral presentation (15%), and a final paper of 9-10 pages in length (40%)"}], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Japanese I", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Noriko Taira Yasohama", "bio": null, "address": "4-354 Kresge Centennial Hall", "phone": "8474671986", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "JAPANESE", "catalog_num": "111-2", "section": "21", "room": "University Hall 312", "meeting_days": "MoTuThFr", "start_time": "10:00:00", "end_time": "10:50:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 15, "overview": "This is a year-long elementary Japanese course beginning each Fall.

In this course, we will focus on an important facet of journalism: investigating potentially wrongful convictions. This class isn't about theory; it's about pursuing the truth about real murder cases, interviewing skittish sources in often tough neighborhoods and prisoners serving time, sometimes decades, for crimes they say they didn't commit. Students will be introduced to a variety of investigative techniques, interviewing skills, approaches to developing sources and employing public documents and databases. Of paramount importance in this class: student safety and adhering to the highest ethical standards in journalism. Students are expected to devote a tremendous amount of time in the field, weekdays and weekends, doing real shoe-leather journalism, knocking on doors, digging for information and determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. Students will be assisted by a veteran private investigator in the class and in the field. Keep in mind: Investigative reporting is hard. Expect to confront roadblocks. Anticipate spinning your wheels. There will be frustrations and setbacks.

The practical side of this course includes: Design of a plastic part within the specified domain, creating a solid model of the part, design of the injection molding tool, creating a solid model of the tooling, creating a cutting path, downloading the cutting path to a CNC machine, machining, injection molding the part, and finally measuring the part geometry and comparing to the original design. \n\nSample past examples are: the relaxing palm beach with attractive fish, the vexing maze, the scary vampire teeth, the daily-used items (trash-can, scissors and key-chain) and the mini-models of transportation tools (unicycle, car and helicopter).", "topic": "CAD/CAM", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 24039, "course_id": 5211, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "desc": "\"Principles of CAD/CAM/CAE Systems\", by Kunwoo Lee, published by Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-38036-6"}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "READING: Course Packet - available at Quartet Copies, 825 Clark Street, Evanston, IL 60201, Tel: 847-328-0720, Fax: 847-328-3286."}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "25% Mid-Term Exam \n25% Final Exam \n15% Homework \n25% Project \n10% Laboratory. \n\nHowever, keep in mind that assessment strategies are subject to change."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "Prerequisite: ME 340-1 or consent of instructor."}], "coursecomponent_set": [{"component": "LAB", "meeting_days": "Th", "start_time": "17:30:00", "end_time": "20:30:00", "section": "25", "room": "Technological Institute AG21"}, {"component": "LAB", "meeting_days": "Th", "start_time": "14:00:00", "end_time": "17:00:00", "section": "24", "room": "Technological Institute AG21"}, {"component": "LAB", "meeting_days": "We", "start_time": "17:00:00", "end_time": "20:00:00", "section": "23", "room": "Technological Institute AG21"}, {"component": "LAB", "meeting_days": "Tu", "start_time": "17:30:00", "end_time": "20:30:00", "section": "22", "room": "Technological Institute AG21"}, {"component": "LAB", "meeting_days": "Tu", "start_time": "14:00:00", "end_time": "17:00:00", "section": "21", "room": "Technological Institute AG21"}, {"component": "LAB", "meeting_days": "Mo", "start_time": "17:00:00", "end_time": "20:00:00", "section": "20", "room": "Technological Institute AG21"}]}, {"title": "Engineering Fluid Mechanics", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "MEAS", "instructor": {"name": "Neelesh A Patankar", "bio": null, "address": "Technological Institute, Rm L490, 2145 Sheridan Rd, EV CAMPUS", "phone": "847/491-3021", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "MECH_ENG", "catalog_num": "373-0", "section": "20", "room": "Tech Institute Lecture Room 3", "meeting_days": "MoTuWeFr", "start_time": "12:00:00", "end_time": "12:50:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 50, "overview": "ME 373 is the second course in fluid mechanics for undergraduates.

We will follow the genre into the 20th century in Vienna (with Franz Lehr), on Broadway (Victor Herbert, Sigmund Romberg), and to Hollywood.  As hybrids that combine classic operetta elements with up-to-date American popular music styles, we will study Jerome Kern's Show Boat (1927) and Emmerich Klmn's Die Herzogin von Chicago [The Duchess of Chicago] (1928).

In this course, we will reexamine the large-scale formal designs of late eighteenth-century music that commonly fall under the rubric of \"sonata form\" in light of these recent developments. The scholar-performer Charles Rosen argued in his seminal Sonata Forms that no one single strategy underlies the movement-level organization of eighteenth-century music, but rather a complex network of related sonata forms. This argument has recently been reanimated and greatly formalized by James Hepokoski and Warren Darcy's Elements of Sonata Theory: Norms, Types, and Deformations in the Late-Eighteenth-Century Sonata (2006, Oxford), which won the Wallace Berry Prize awarded by the Society for Music Theory (2008). The course will reexamine the concept of \"sonata form\" via a close reading of the central precepts and formal categories of Hepokoski and Darcy's Sonata Theory, alongside close readings of works from the period. A central focal point of our reexamination will be what Hepokoski and Darcy call \"dialogic form\": it stipulates that eighteenth-century composers conceived of large-scale formal design in terms of low-level \"modules\" that together generate larger formal \"spaces\" oriented towards specific cadences. The modular construction, the spatial templates, and the cadences work as a network of compositional \"options\" or \"generic defaults\" tacitly known to the composer through familiarity with the style. At any given moment, a work is in \"dialogue with a constellation of normative sonata options.\" In this, their theory of dialogic form claims not only to provide the means for producing analyses that are \"historically and musically sensitive,\" but also to \"reconstruct the historical norms\" of the period.", "topic": "Sonata Forms", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26001, "course_id": 3733, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Learning Objectives", "desc": "Students will acquire familiarity with the theoretical concepts of Sonata Theory and gain fluency in analyzing works using its vocabulary and concepts.

Throughout the course students can expect to learn how determine what types of employees businesses will need for the future, create a strategic talent management plan for a case study organization, define metrics for measuring talent utilization, expand interviewing skills to acquire talent, increase awareness of how to accelerate strategic plans through the talent management process and what generational expectations are with respect to development and career succession.", "topic": "Talent Management", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27697, "course_id": 8275, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Plant Evolution & Diversity Lab", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "TGS", "instructor": {"name": "Patrick S Herendeen", "bio": null, "address": "Hogan Hall, 6-140B, 2205 Tech Drive", "phone": "847/835-6956", "office_hours": "TBA"}, "subject": "PBC", "catalog_num": "401-0", "section": "20", "room": "Technological Institute LG62", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "09:00:00", "end_time": "11:50:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 20, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27585, "course_id": 16526, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Quantitative Methods for Ecology & Conservation", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "TGS", "instructor": {"name": "Stuart Wagenius", "bio": null, "address": "156 PCSC Chicago Botanic Garden, Glencoe", "phone": "847/835-6978", "office_hours": "By appointment"}, "subject": "PBC", "catalog_num": "435-0", "section": "20", "room": "Technological Institute MG51", "meeting_days": "Mo", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "11:50:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 12, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 26154, "course_id": 17781, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Production Laboratory", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Paul C Edwards", "bio": null, "address": "Annie May Swift Hall, Room G03", "phone": "847/491-3171", "office_hours": null}, "subject": "PERF_ST", "catalog_num": "119-0", "section": "20", "room": "TBA", "meeting_days": null, "start_time": null, "end_time": null, "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 20, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 25148, "course_id": 18610, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Performance of Poetry", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "SPCH", "instructor": {"name": "Carol Simpson Stern", "bio": null, "address": null, "phone": null, "office_hours": null}, "subject": "PERF_ST", "catalog_num": "210-1", "section": "20", "room": "Annie May Swift Hall 103", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "12:30:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 20, "overview": "The course is an examination of poetry in performance and a consideration of poetic forms.

We place African-American identities within a global and historical context through works of self-representation taken from film, literature and performance.

But is it true that freedom brushes against the grain of equality and vice versa? Does more of one necessarily mean less of the other? In this seminar we will closely examine the significance of each of these ideals in order to arrive at a clearer understanding of the relationship between them. \n\tFreedom is, without doubt, one of the most cherished modern political ideals. But how exactly should we understand the meaning of this ideal? For example, is freedom simply the absence of external interference in our affairs? Or, are certain social conditions pre-requisites for living a free life? Does, for example, a lack of material resources diminish one's freedom? And should we think of taxation as an infringement upon individual freedom? What these questions make clear is that freedom is a contested ideal. That is to say, political disagreements are not simply about how much freedom we should have. More often than not, such disagreements are about how to understand the meaning of the ideal of freedom itself. \n\tAs we will see, the meaning of the ideal of equality is no less contested. For instance, should we think of equality as a matter of equal voice in democratic self-government? Or is political equality more a matter of how resources, wealth, or other goods are distributed among citizens? Is it wrong, for example, for there to be large gaps between rich and poor? If so, why? Does the ideal of equality require a leveled and conformist society in which important differences between citizens are elided? \n\t By the end of the course, students can expect to have become conversant in the ideas of some of contemporary political philosophy's most prominent and important thinkers. In addition students can expect to improve both their analytical writing skills as well as their ability to interpret and evaluate complex arguments.

However, no previous knowledge of any specific science is required; the cases will only remain at an elementary commonsense level and serve as illustrations of certain philosophical quandaries. For example, one might wonder why exactly an agnostic but scientifically minded person ought to believe in strings, unverifiable by direct experiment as they are, while he or she thinks it's OK not to believe in other non-verifiable entities like God. Similarly, one might wonder what the difference between creationism and standard evolutionary biology is that justifies regarding one as a correct description of nature and the other an optional system of belief. The former is a metaphysical question that responds to our expectation that scientific theories tell us how the world is, even when that means telling us about invisibly small or unreachably remote parts of nature and the universe. The latter is am epistemological question that responds to our expectation that science is an excellent example of objectivity, in the sense that when something is established following the methods good scientists use, then we ought to believe it. The course will try to introduce in both sorts of issues raised by modern natural science, that is, it will concentrate on methodological questions and the question of realism. We will be guided by nested \"what does it take\"-questions. For example: What does it take for a system of sentences to count as a good scientific theory? What does it take for a scientific theory to be testable by observational and experimental data (and, by the way: what does it take for certain series of experiences to count as data or observations?)? What does it take for a given theory to be better supported by the available evidence than its competitors? What does it take for a given theory to explain the known phenomena in an area of knowledge? What does it take for an explanatory scientific theory to be credited with reference to underlying structures of reality? We will begin with a brief overview of the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17 th century, and then turn to the treatment of certain problems in the contemporary literature, like the problem of induction, the problem of the underdetermination of theory choice by the available data, the problem of rationality and conceptual change, the problem of realism.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Ethics & Values Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 23404, "course_id": 2607, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Godfrey-Smith, Peter: \tTheory and Reality, Chicago: Chicago UP, 2003.

Or are these theories rather instruments to calculate, predict and explain the relations among observable events?

The seminar will also try to complement the reading with hints at the effectual history of Kant's ideas and argumentative structures in more recent philosophical debates. Examples are: Kant qualified his philosophy as \"transcendental idealism and empirical realism\", meaning that it was a position that tried to avoid having to choose between saying that we must have an unconceptualised access to reality in order to have factual knowledge and saying that the reality we come to consider as the object of our factual knowledge is determined by our concepts. Kant's way out seems to suggest that this is a non-issue because we only have one set of concepts that constitutes the form of human experience in general. Does Kant's analysis of the impasse and his indication of the way out still have something to tell even though his specific solutions (one set of forms of all possible objects of experience, one set of categories to form judgments, one set of principles to form natural laws) may have become doubtful? Where do criticisms of the analytic-synthetic dichotomy leave Kant (or where does Kant leave them)? Much of modern and contemporary philosophy of mind centers on the question of the relation between mind and reality. Kant criticized all attempts at founding factual knowledge on self-knowledge (which lead into \"paralogisms\") or knowledge of unconceptualised reality in itself (which lead to \"antinomies\"). Both have to be presupposed, but can't become objects of factual knowledge themselves. Does this dissolve the problems of mind and reality or rather make them cognitively insolvable?", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27655, "course_id": 2616, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Suggested)", "desc": "VERY recommended: Howard Caygill: A Kant Dictionary, London/Cambridge MA: Blackwell 1995."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Immanuel Kant: Critique of Pure Reason, trans.

But how exactly do facts about what we should do depend on facts about what our actual aims are?

What are the alternatives to this way of thinking about how the so-called \"instrumental principle\" bears on what I should do? </p> \n<p> The first half of the seminar will focus on these and related questions about the normativity (or lack thereof) of the instrumental principle.

For instance, how do predictions about what we will have reason to want in the future bear on which actions we should perform now? How stable should our intentions be - that is, under what conditions should we consider revising our plans as opposed to sticking with them?

Several questions guide our inquiry.  What are the ideals that should organize our collective life - justice, liberty, equality, democracy, or something else?  What exactly do these concepts mean?  What is the source of our political obligations, and what are the limits to what the state can legitimately expect from us?  What should be the scope of the political community, particularly in a time of increasing globalization and interconnectedness?  We examine these questions and how prominent thinkers have answered them by reading \"classic\" texts, but the aim of the course is to challenge you to confront these questions yourself and to think critically about the nature of politics and political ideas.  We also pay close attention to the practical implications of the theories we explore, considering how they might inform our understanding and response to concrete problems such as economic inequality, the provision of health care, same-sex marriage, and the like.", "topic": null, "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27721, "course_id": 15671, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Readings will likely include:\nThe Republic of Plato.

One of our chief aims will be to consider how different segments of the population have been affected by these changing fortunes.  We also will examine blacks' relations with whites and their engagement with mainstream political institutions.  In doing so, we will take up several topics that have occupied students of race and American politics since the civil rights movement: party politics, black-white voting patterns, group conflict and prejudice, the tension between integration and segregation, welfare policy, and political representation, including the election of the country's first black president.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Social & Behavioral Sciences Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27006, "course_id": 2787, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Notes", "desc": "Attendance at first class strongly recommended."}, {"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "Course Reader\n\nKing, Kendra. 2010.

What is this crisis? In an oft-cited comparison, it has been noted that when Ghana became independent in 1957 its' citizens enjoyed a higher level of income and standard of living than did citizens of South Korea.  According to the United National Development Programme's Human Development Report 2010, South Korea has a per capita income (converted for purchasing parity) of $22,029, compared to Ghana's $2,480.  Now, South Koreans can expect to live an average of 77.9 years, which is 18.8 years longer than the average for Ghana.  Of the 177 countries that this report rates across a range of social indicators, all but one of the bottom 25 states are located in Africa.  This latter figure indicates Africa's low position in a global hierarchy of development, an outcome that would have been surprising to many observers in the 1950s and 1960s. \n\nThe bulk of this course will trace developments that have played significant roles in shaping the internal politics of Africa's states.  The first part of the course focuses on colonial legacies, Pan-African visions of a post-colonial future, struggles for national liberation, the role of ethnicity in political life, military coups d'tats, and the rise of \"big men\" and patronage politics.  The second part of the course takes stock of dramatic developments since the 1980s.  The first concerns the nearly universal wave of economic reforms.  These include reforms of indigenous origin and those that the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have designed.   The second concerns the replacement of authoritarian regimes with electoral multi-party civilian regimes through the combined pressures of indigenous and outside forces.  The last part of the course considers the trajectories of contemporary African politics.  These include the problem of so-called \"failed states\" and internal conflict, a condition that has directly affected about a dozen of Africa's 52 states since 2000.  We will also consider cases of very rapid economic growth, such as has occurred in Ethiopia, and ponder the rising influence of China, both as a source of investment and as a development  model.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Social & Behavioral Sciences Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27038, "course_id": 2808, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "**NOTE THAT THESE BOOKS WERE ASSIGNED IN 2009.

Are non-state actors such as transnational NGOs or international organizations supplanting the authority and power of the state in global politics?

This subject is interesting for several reasons. First, there are a lot of wars of this type and understanding their dynamics is a worthwhile pursuit. Second, those interested in policy should be intrigued, as the United States military fights in two major civil wars (Iraq and Afghanistan) and has been engaged indirectly in others (i.e., Somalia and Philippines). Third, these wars present scholars with an intellectual quandary: Students of the historical development of institutions consider warfare to be a central element of state-building. Students of contemporary civil wars associate these with state collapse.  Has the nature of the war - state relationship undergone a fundamental shift?  Ultimately, studying war and political development offers wider intellectual payoffs in terms of conceptualizing the roles of violence, militia recruitment, and ideology in political relationships and formal institutions.\n\nEvents of the past two decades in particular have highlighted the roles of state failure, ethnic strife, enterprising commanders, elements of international politics and geography in civil wars. Are ethnic tensions, great power strategies, religious extremism, colonialism, class warfare, resource competition, ideology or state failure to blame for these conflicts?  Why and how do civil wars end?  What is the impact of international efforts to mediate these conflicts?  \n\nThis course is divided into five sections.  \n\n The first section is called Section Zero because this class assumes no prior specialized knowledge of its subject. This section examines the magnitude of the contemporary phenomenon of civil wars. It considers the role of these wars in state building in history in Europe and asks whether contemporary civil wars can play such a role, and if not, why not.  Some argue that these wars are \"new wars\" and are different in terms of their internal dynamics and impacts, while others doubt that this is so.\n Section I focuses on individual and group-level explanations of causes of civil wars. Do greedy individuals cause these wars? Are contemporary armed groups akin to bandits or criminal syndicates? What is the role of ethnic identity in these conflicts? Is ethnicity simply an instrumental response to the uncertainties of warfare?  How do material resource endowments shape how and whether people fight? Is there a place for ideology and grievances in a field of study that focuses on materialist rational choice perspectives? What role does violence play in civil wars? Is it a cause of fighting or is it endogenous to a process of shaping the strategies of combatants?  \n Section II looks at elite politics and state-level explanations of civil wars. How do the defensive or ambitious strategies of elite groups influence these wars? Are contemporary studies of elite strategy smuggling in class analysis?  What is the relationship of politics of elite survival and some of the micro-politics that we will study later? \n Section III shifts the focus to structural-level considerations of the impact of changes in the international system of states on the evolution of civil wars. Has a special kind of \"war-prone\" state regime developed in the twentieth century that (alongside economic globalization) has created a basis for \"new wars\"?   It also considers the impact of geography and environmental degradation. Are some states simply badly configured? Is the problem of environmental collapse a present or likely future cause of civil wars?\n The final [imagined] section would have been next if we operated on a semester system. We would have considered international intervention and other elements of conflict management. What is the impact of international justice, either as a palliative or a deterrent to violence? How do pressures and evolving norms in the international community to promote democracy shape the behavior of armed groups? We will not be able to consider the vast topic of counterinsurgency and the impact of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars on civil wars, though these considerations are relevant to the topics that we will study.\n\nThis is not a course about international law or global norms and warfare, though these issues appear in many readings. It is not about conflict management and post-conflict reconstruction, although those with interests in these issues will find much of value in the material here. Finally, this is not a course about counterinsurgency, although those with such interests will find much of value in this seminar. \n\nA matter that often arises among students of civil wars is the battle between \"ivory tower eggheads\" and \"people of action\". The latter often split between the NGO - international organization world (humanitarian workers, human rights lawyers, etc) and the military.  They can disagree amongst themselves, while finding common ground that eggheads have little to say that is useful.  Some eggheads are cloistered, but this instructor tries to strike a balance. The practitioners can benefit from the big frameworks and the logics and questions that scholars pose.  Since in addition to reading a lot of books, the instructor has direct experience with conflicts in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Congo, Somalia, Sudan, the Caucasus and a few others, this is a balance that should be within the grasp of this course.", "topic": "War and Political Development", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27060, "course_id": 2862, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "**NOTE: THESE BOOKS WERE ASSIGNED IN 2010.

How do infants and toddlers develop an attachment to their parents or caretakers? How does children's thinking and problem solving change across childhood and adolescence? How do parents' beliefs and values influence children's development and school achievement? How do parents' discipline style influence children's social and personality development? As each new topic is introduced, students are encouraged to think critically about the assumptions and methods that underlie research on particular issues. A central goal is to help students develop an appreciation of different criteria for evaluating research and other forms of evidence.

Rather, most faculty tend to use - and expect their advanced undergraduate students to use - one of the many computer software packages that are available for this purpose.  Thus, this course will have two major foci.  First, we will introduce advanced topics not covered in many sections of Introductory Statistics such as Multiple Regression and Factorial Analysis of Variance.

The sacred is paradoxical in nature: it is in the world but also outside of it; it is auspicious but also dangerous; it is all-powerful but extremely vulnerable. Its counterpart, \"the profane\" is no less of a riddle: it is both the neutral (non-sacred) and the negative; it is both the default state and the \"fallen\" state. Our premise in this course will be that the concepts of \"sacred\" and \"profane\" have no single or fixed set of meanings, but rather that sacredness is a language that is being used to express different ideas on community, relation to the divine, body, death, and other topics that are crucial to self- and group-definition. \nThe goals of this course are twofold. First, our goal is to explore the different facets of the language of the sacred and the profane and the complexity and richness of these concepts in ancient Jewish culture. Second, our goal is to become familiar with the textual world of ancient Judaism - the Bible, the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, Hellenistic Jewish literature, the Dead Sea Scrolls, rabbinic legal and homiletic literature, and ancient liturgy. The combination of these two goals constitutes a third goal: getting to know, through the prism of the sacred, the dynamics of the interpretive process, and the ways in which ancient texts acquire new meanings through time. Our ultimate purpose in this course is to learn how texts make a culture, and how religious ideas and concepts regain vitality and acquire new meanings through textual practices.\n\nPreparation and assignments. \nFirst, prior to every class you will be asked to read several texts (usually a combination of primary texts and a scholarly work), and the discussion in class will be based on the assumption that you have indeed read the assigned pieces. In order to ensure that you come to class after having read and thought of the texts, and that you can engage in a conversation about them, you are asked to prepare talking points for every class. That is to say, write down for yourself before each class several observations or questions about the readings that were assigned to this class. The talking points will constitute 30% of your grade. \nSecondly, your participation and involvement is vital, and is worth 10% of your grade.\nFinally, twice during the quarter (once in the middle and once at the end) you will get a take-home assignment, which will consist of four passages of primary texts - three that we have discussed in class and a fourth which you have not yet seen, but speaks to general topics discussed in the course. You will be asked to analyze and explain each passage, and to discuss the themes that emerge in them.

These new births were followed by a political reconfiguring of the European map, the expansion of economic capitalism, religious wars, and the development of modern ways of being. Mixed into this political, cultural, economic, and historical brew is religion, in the case considered by this course, the Christian religion.

We will approach these topics through a variety of disciplines -- including religious studies, history, art history and anthropology -- and with a variety of sources, including hagiography, miracle collections, chronicles, church architecture, and cult statues/images. Students will have an opportunity to analyze these lived traditions during two field trips, one to a local (Chicagoland) shrine, and one to a regional site.  Students will also be encouraged to relate their own academic interests to these topics through a final research paper and presentation.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Ethics & Values Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27132, "course_id": 12848, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "<ul>\n<li>Course packet (available at Quartet Copies)</li>\n<li>Peter Brown's The Cult of the Saints: Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity (ISBN 0226076229)</li>\n</ul>"}, {"name": "Evaluation Method", "desc": "Class participation includes: class attendance, class discussion, field trip attendance, and online work."}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "No registration requirements, but completion of Intro to Christianity is strongly suggested."}], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Theories of Religion", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Sarah Hieatt Jacoby", "bio": null, "address": "Department of Religious Studies, Crowe Hall 5-179, 1860 Campus Drive, Evanston, IL 60208", "phone": "8474671304", "office_hours": "Wed 1-3, Crowe 4-149"}, "subject": "RELIGION", "catalog_num": "395-0", "section": "20", "room": "Annenberg Hall G30", "meeting_days": "Fr", "start_time": "10:00:00", "end_time": "12:50:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 15, "overview": "What is \"theory\"?

To better understand reality TV's origins and impact on the American television industry this class examines the history, reception, and influence of one of its defining examples: Survivor. Survivor was imported to the United States from Sweden in the spring of 2001 and quickly became one of America's most-watched and talked about television programs. The show's runaway success propelled the CBS network to the top of the Nielsen television ratings and transformed producer Mark Burnett into one of television's most sought-after producers. It also launched the current reality TV boom, inspiring a host of programs that emulated its format, structure, and visual style. While most of these programs have long since had their torches snuffed. Survivor has managed to out wit, out last, and out play its competition, and in the fall of 2011 it began its twenty-third season on CBS.

The 1948 Paramount et. al. decision led to a restructuring of the major Hollywood studios, totally changing the economic structure and social organization of the studio system.  At the same time, the post-World War II baby boom, rapid suburban development, and growth of commercial television (among other things) contributed to a substantial decline in, and redistribution of, film audiences.  Meanwhile, the Cold War and anti-Communist sentiment set a tone of destructive suspicion that extended to the film industry.  Political and social issues that initially smoldered beneath the surface of everyday life, or appeared mainly in subcultural arenas, eventually turned into manifest conflicts with significant impact on American society.  The apparent conformity and prosperity of the 1950s gave way to overt cultural, social, and political upheavalCivil Rights, Women's Liberation, Gay Liberation, the anti-Vietnam War movement, the Counterculture, etc.  This class examines the American cinema of these two decades from aesthetic, industrial, social, and cultural perspectives.  \n\nThe class includes weekly screenings and lecture/discussion.

We will consider the consequences of the changing ways in which adults have conceptualized children: are they \"incomplete\" adults? Pure, nave, and natural innocents? Creatures of instinct that must be shaped by adult training? Autonomous, independent individuals who deserve the same rights and freedoms as adults? Media texts created for children over the past century help us to distinguish and interrogate these various perspectives on the nature of childhood. Children have been seen as a particularly vulnerable part of the media audience, and the investigation of children's media has much to tell us about regimes of media censorship, theories about media influence on behavior and identity, and the media's role in education and marketing.

Slavic 210-1 begins by immersing students in the world of Pushkin's Russia, a glittering nineteenth-century world of brilliant balls, deadly duels and plush palaces.  We will read Pushkin's novel-in-verse EUGENE ONEGIN, and consider both Tchaikovsky's famous operatic adaptation and the recent film version starring Ralph Fiennes.  We also read Mikhail Lermontov, who lived and moved in the same circles as Aleksandr Pushkin, and whose novel HERO OF OUR TIME provides fascinating insight into Russian military life in the Caucasus during this period.  Finally, Nikolai Gogol provides a surreal commentary on this Russia in his DEAD SOULS, a novel  that successfully combines terrifying and hilarious elements.

Globalization means greater interdependence and less national autonomy. It occurs as international flows of capital, goods, services, and people increase. But transactions and relationships involving capital, goods, services and people do not stand on their own. Rather, they are sustained and regulated by an institutional foundation that typically centers on the legal system. As part of globalization, particular legal and institutional forms are also spreading throughout the world. Transactions, interactions and relationships that formerly occurred within national boundaries now occur across them. Because the legal and institutional frameworks that support these transactions exist primarily at the level of the nation-state, a governance mismatch has emerged. Globalization means that more is going on between national jurisdictions than within them, and tensions arise between competing institutional models. Thus, globalization motivates both an extension of legal systems (into the international interstices), and a confrontation between different legal systems that can be resolved conflictually (one model replaces the other) or non-conflictually (e.g., legal harmonization). Either outcome leads to institutional convergence. We consider a number of different kinds of law but focus especially on commercial law, quasi-legal trade agreements (e.g., WTO), and commercially-relevant quasi-legal institutions (ADR). We pay attention to legal developments in developing and transitional economies, and also consider how the international community deals with a significant common problem like global climate change.", "topic": null, "attributes": "Social & Behavioral Sciences Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27902, "course_id": 20044, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "John Braithwaite and Peter Drahos.

Writing the Hispanic Caribbean \nThe Caribbean is a space of cultural flows, connections and interruptions, a territory whose history and identity have been determined by travel and up-rootedness.  Caribbean literary production is often characterized as a practice of translation, negotiation, and appropriation, a power struggle with cultural traditions that span both sides of the Atlantic. This course will explore the ways in which writers the Hispanic Caribbean have imagined, understood and defined the Caribbean and its culture(s). Through a reading of texts from Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and Latino-Caribbean writers in the diaspora, we will look at how Caribbean writers and intellectuals have addressed such issues as slavery and colonialism, race and national identity, cultural \"authenticity,\" and diaspora.  Course readings will be drawn from the work of authors such as Gertrudis Gmez de Avellaneda, Ana Lydia Vega, Jos Luis Gonzlez, Nicols Guilln, Fernando Ortiz, Toms Hernndez Franco, Manuel Ramos Otero, Virgilio Piera, Antonio Jos Ponte, Rita Indiana Hernndez, Aurora Arias and Junot Daz.\n\nPrerequisite: 1 course from 250, 251, 260, or 261", "topic": "Repeating Islands?", "attributes": "Literature & Fine Arts Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27081, "course_id": 3194, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []},{"title": "Introduction to Statistics", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Wenxin Jiang", "bio": null, "address": "2006 Sheridan, Room 203/Department of Statistics", "phone": "847.491.5081", "office_hours": "TBA"}, "subject": "STAT", "catalog_num": "202-0", "section": "20", "room": "University Hall 122", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "11:00:00", "end_time": "12:20:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 60, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": "Formal Studies Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27140, "course_id": 3388, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Introduction to Statistics", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "WCAS", "instructor": {"name": "Wenxin Jiang", "bio": null, "address": "2006 Sheridan, Room 203/Department of Statistics", "phone": "847.491.5081", "office_hours": "TBA"}, "subject": "STAT", "catalog_num": "202-0", "section": "21", "room": "University Hall 122", "meeting_days": "TuTh", "start_time": "12:30:00", "end_time": "13:50:00", "start_date": "2012-01-03", "end_date": "2012-03-10", "seats": 65, "overview": null, "topic": null, "attributes": "Formal Studies Distro Area\n\n", "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 27528, "course_id": 3388, "coursedesc_set": [], "coursecomponent_set": []}, {"title": "Introduction to Statistics", "term": "2012 Winter", "school": "UC", "instructor": {"name": "Mohyeddin Kassar", "bio": "Mohyeddin Kassar is a financial economist with more than fifteen years experience.

In this course, we will use textual analysis and performance activities to engage three seminal twentieth century practitioners and their work: Bertolt Brecht and his Epic Theatre of strange-making and social struggle; Antonin Artaud's magnificently perverse, multi-sensory Theatre of Cruelty; and Peter Brook, whose Immediate Theatre combined Brecht and Artaud's theories for a late 20th century audience. Historical contexts, artistic influences, and frameworks for problematization of each figure will be discussed, emphasizing the process through which avant-gardes arise and become assimilated into mainstream theatrical practiceincluding the work we do in Chicago.

what is often called literary journalism, narrative nonfiction, or what John McPhee calls \"the literature of fact.\" The best of nonfiction narrative wields a fierce power, poking and prodding our preconceptions of the world, pushing us to look at ourselves and others through a different prism. What makes for a compelling story? (What tools might we borrow from fiction?) Why employ the use of narrative? How does it help form our view of people and events? We'll explore the craft of reporting and research which borrows from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, history and sociology - and work with rigor and discipline on the art of good writing. We'll read nonfiction narratives-both book and magazine articles-on a host of subjects, ranging from war and poverty to the environment and sports. We'll work in this class as a professional writer might, from draft to draft. There will be regular writing assignments, and students will be asked to craft a longer narrative on a subject of interest to them. The course will be run as a seminar, so there will be an emphasis on critical class discussion.", "topic": "Telling Stories", "attributes": null, "requirements": null, "component": "LEC", "class_num": 21408, "course_id": 3467, "coursedesc_set": [{"name": "Class Materials (Required)", "desc": "\"Strength in What Remains\" by Tracy Kidder  IBSN-10: 0812977610\n\"The Laramie Project\" by Moises Kaufman  ISBN-10:  0375727191\n\"Denial\" by Jessica Stern ISBN-10: 006162666X"}, {"name": "Registration Requirements", "desc": "This course is open by application only to undergraduates.
